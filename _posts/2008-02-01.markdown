We address the problem of bandwidth selection in MLS surfaces. While
the problem has received relatively little attention in the
literature, we show that appropriate selection plays a critical role
in the quality of reconstructed surfaces. We formulate the MLS
polynomial fitting step as a kernel regression problem for both
noiseless and noisy data. Based on this framework, we develop fast
algorithms to find optimal bandwidths for a large class of weight
functions. We show experimental comparisons of our method, which
outperforms heuristically chosen functions and weights previously
proposed. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of the
Levin's two-step MLS projection for bandwidth selection.
