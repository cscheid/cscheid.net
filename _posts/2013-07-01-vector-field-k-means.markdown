Scientists study trajectory data to understand trends in movement
patterns, such as human mobility for trafﬁc analysis and urban
planning. In this paper, we introduce a novel trajectory clustering
technique whose central idea is to use vector ﬁelds to induce a notion
of similarity between trajectories, letting the vector ﬁelds
themselves deﬁne and represent each cluster. We present an efﬁcient
algorithm to ﬁnd a locally optimal clustering of trajectories into
vector ﬁelds, and demonstrate how vector-ﬁeld k-means can ﬁnd patterns
missed by previous methods. We present experimental evidence of its
effectiveness and efﬁciency using several datasets, including
historical hurricane data, GPS tracks of people and vehicles, and
anonymous cellular radio handoffs from a large service provider.
