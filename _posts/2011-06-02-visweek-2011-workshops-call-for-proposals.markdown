title: "VisWeek 2011 Workshops Call for Proposals"
---

Last year at VisWeek, we had a fantastic
[workshop
program](http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/session/workshops.html), ranging from
topology to
[visualization
theories](http://eagereyes.org/infovis-theory-workshop) to
storytelling and
[health care in visualization](http://research.ihost.com/vahc2010/). We're
organizing workshops again this year, and we need your help! On behalf
of [Danyel Fisher](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/danyelf/), [Enrico Bertini](http://enrico.bertini.me/) and myself, I'd like to ask you to
consider sending a workshop proposal to VisWeek 2011.

Do you have a new and exciting theme in Information Visualization,
Scientific Visualization, or Visual Analytics? Do you want to bring
together a group of experts for an intensive day of discussion about
visualization? Workshops are an informal setting to discuss important
and trending topics in visualizations. Workshops will be held
throughout VisWeek, and will be promoted in the conference program.

Consider sending a half-day or full-day workshop proposal to
VisWeek 2011. Proposals are due by Monday, June 20, 2011.

More details can be found at
the
VisWeek website or by contacting us.
