title: "How many VisWeek papers could the NYT write in three weeks?"
---

Last week's [VisWeek](http://visweek.org) finished with Amanda Cox's
amazing capstone talk about the visualization work that goes on at the
[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com). As everyone in the room was
rightfully being blown away by the incredible productivity of their
graphics department, [Tim Lebo](http://twitter.com/timrdf)
[asked](https://twitter.com/#!/timrdf/status/129943843171868672): How
many papers could NYT submit in 3 weeks?

This same sentiment echoed in the hallways after her talk. Now, I
don't know what this number is; but I know what it should be. It
should be *zero*! NYT obviously has much to say about visualization,
but there is an important distinction. I think it is important to not
confuse the top-of-the-line visualization practices as seen in the NYT
with what we do at VisWeek. Let me be more specific.

For example, I see at least two reasons for design study papers at
VisWeek. First, these might offer a comprehensive view of the design
space for a particular type of data or visual primitive. A great
example of this type of paper this year was Claessen and van Wijk's
[Flexible Linked Axes for Multivariate Data
Visualization](http://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/tg/2011/12/ttg2011122310-abs.html). As
Jarke put it in his talk, one of the questions design study papers
should strive to answer is "is there all that is?". In other words:
have we looked at the entire design space? Why or why not? Those are
typically research questions, and deserve papers. The other reason for
a design study paper at VisWeek is to highlight an especially
important area of current research in domain sciences, and point at
directions of future work. I almost see these papers as provocations:
they show how other areas might need visualization, and how our
research might use those other areas' problems and research questions
as framing devices for our own problems and research
questions. [Miriah Meyer](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~miriah/)'s recent
biological visualization papers are the perfect examples of this kind
of research program.

Although I have not asked the NYT directly, I think it is fair to claim
that their graphics department does not, and should not,
care about either of the categories above. The NYT is in the business
of informing people in a timely manner, as truthfully, thoroughly and
compellingly as possible. We now know that visualizations are an
integral aspect of this process, and it is rewarding and stimulating to see
visualizations executed with the skill and speed of which only the NYT
seems to be capable. But notice that neither of these says anything
about *research* in visualization!

We are in the business of *understanding* visualizations: why,
when, and how they work. We are in the business of *making it
easier* to produce good, compelling visualizations. We are even in the
business of screaming to the rest of the world, at the top of our
lungs, that they should be using visualizations, and not stupid Excel
tables of numeric values.  As our field becomes more practical and has
more impact, it is important to keep in mind, however, that we are
*not* in the business of actually producing visualizations,
however fun and rewarding that might be. Bringing brilliant
practitioners such as Amanda Cox to our conference is the ideal way of
interacting with visualization as it is practiced. Thinking that the
work which goes on at the NYT should become our research is not.
