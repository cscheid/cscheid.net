title: "How to hide the noise for LaTeX"
---

(Thanks to
[John](https://twitter.com/johnregehr/status/887713442013913088) for
this one.) If you're perpetually annoyed by the amount of stdout noise
that LaTeX generates, then instead of running

    pdflatex foo

run

    texfot pdflatex foo

It makes a world of difference.
