title: "Nanocubes"

Come look at my new project,
[nanocubes](http://www.nanocubes.net), in collaboration with my
co-workers Jim Klosowski and Lauro Lins. Nanocubes are in-memory
datacubes for spatiotemporal data. They enable super-fast interactive,
exploratory visualizations of large datasets. The live demos on the
site show up to 200 million data points.

There's a forthcoming paper describing the work, and the software will
be open-sourced sooner rather than later. Until then, have fun with
the demos! Feedback is more than appreciated.
