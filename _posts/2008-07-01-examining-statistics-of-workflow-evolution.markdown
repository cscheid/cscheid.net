As provenance-enabled systems are deployed, and increasing volumes of
provenance information are collected, there is a unique opportunity
to leverage and obtain useful knowledge from this data. In this paper,
we take a first step at analyzing this data. We present a preliminary
analysis of workflow evolution provenance generated by thirty subjects
who worked on six distinct exploratory tasks over the period of four
months. This initial analysis shows that useful statistics can be
extracted from this data that provide insights into how different
people interact with workflow systems to solve problems.
