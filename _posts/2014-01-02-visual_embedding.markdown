In this paper, we present an operational definition of "good
visualization" based on matching mathematical structures of the input
and output spaces. We introduce *visual embedding* as a model for
visualization construction. We define a visualization as a function
that maps from a domain of data points to a range of visual
primitives. We claim a visualization is good if the embedded visual
elements preserve structures present in the data domain. Concretely,
we show how striving to preserve *metrics* leads to implementations of
colormap design, glyph selection and quantitative evaluation
algorithms.
