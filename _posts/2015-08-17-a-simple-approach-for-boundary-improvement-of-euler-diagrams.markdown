General methods for drawing Euler diagrams tend to generate irregular
polygons. Yet, empirical evidence indicates that smoother contours
make these diagrams easier to read. In this paper, we present a simple
method to smooth the boundaries of any Euler diagram drawing. When
refining the diagram, the method must ensure that set elements remain
inside their appropriate boundaries and that no region is removed or
created in the diagram. Our approach uses a force system that improves
the diagram while at the same time ensuring its topological structure
does not change. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
through case studies and quantitative evaluations.
