title: "Review: Qisan MagicForce mechanical keyboards"
---

tl;dr: if $70 is not a problem for you and you've never tried a
mechanical keyboard, go buy a Cherry MX Brown Qisan MagicForce 68
keyboard right now. It's _easily_ worth it.

I recently had a cheap MS keyboard die on me. I'd heard all about
how mechanical keyboards are so much better than membrane keyboards,
but the price tag always scared me off.  This time, I found a
mechanical keyboard being sold on Amazon for a much cheaper price, and
decided to buy one on a whim.  Two months later I found myself having
purchased four separate versions of the keyboard, and let me tell you:
you should seriously consider buying of them.  I'm talking
specifically about the [MagicForce
68](https://www.amazon.com/Qisan-Keyboard-Mechanical-Backlight-keyboard/dp/B01872MCIA),
which right now costs $70 on Amazon.
The main thing about these mechanical keyboards is that, well, typing
on them is incomparably nicer than typing on cheap keyboards.  I
confess that I used to bin mechanical keyboard people right along
audiophiles (no, don't get me started), and well, consider this post
as penance.

When shopping for mechanical keyboards, you'll find that the main
thing people discuss is which kind of switch the keyboard uses. The
switch is the actual mechanical part that activates when you press
down on the key. Again, I didn't think that picking specific parts
could make that much of a difference. But hey, I was already buying a
number of these keyboards, so might as well do the research
experiment. And, lo and behold, they actually feel fairly different!
To be clear, either of these three keyboards is a serious improvement
over non-mechanical switches, but they're sufficiently different from
one another that at this point I'm happy recommending one specific
kind: Cherry MX brown switches.

Here are the switches I tested: I got one keyboard 
with [Gateron
brown](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&c=306)
switches, one with [Cherry MX blue](https://www.cherrymx.de/en/products/mx-blue.html) switches, and
one with [Cherry MX Brown](https://www.cherrymx.de/en/products/mx-brown.html)
switches. [Cherry](http://cherryamericas.com/) is the company famous
for making good keyboard parts, and their switches are the gold
standard. The different colors stand for the ways in which these
switches feel different. The thing to know is that the blue switches
are the loved/dreaded "clicky" switches: they have an additional sliding part that
makes an audible click sound, in addition to the sound of the keycap (the
thing you press down on) hitting the actual board part of the
keyboard. If you're interested in how these operate, the Keyboard
Company has a [good
article](https://www.keyboardco.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/an-introduction-to-cherry-mx-mechanical-switches/)
with animations of how the different switches operate. Gateron, on the
other hand, is a brand that simply attempts to produce lower-costed
clones of the Cherry MX switches.

Overall, I found the Gateron switches to be totally fine (and boards
with Gateron switches are about $10 cheaper on the whole than the
Cherry MX equivalents), but they're just a little too smooshy. Both
Gateron browns and Cherry MX browns are both super quiet to type, but the
Cherry MX have slightly more satisfying feedback when the key actually
registers. As a result, I find myself typing a little more softly with
the Cherry MX keyboard than with the Gaterons. The Cherry MX blues, on
the other hand, make an incredibly satisfying sound (well, if you're
into that kind of stuff, I suppose) when you press a key. But I find
their activation force to be a little too big, and also their feedback
is too "hard": the key resists a little too much just before the
clicking and activating. And some people are annoyed by the clicky sound, 
so make sure you're not going to be that jerk in the office.

The MagicForce keyboard itself has a number of nice features (which I
don't really care about, but) including LED-backlit keys (white LEDs
on the brown switches and bright blue LEDs on the blue switches).  The
actual keyboard layout is fine too, except that you don't get a row of
function keys - that's why they're "compact keyboards". Instead, you
get a "Fn" key that you press with the number keys. I found that a
non-issue. However, if you're a heavy user of R or sh-like shells, you
should know that the backtick is slightly unergonomic: you have to hit
Fn-Esc to get it. Similarly, a tilde requires shift-Esc. These come up
almost never for me, so I alredy got used to it. But if you need your
function keys often, you might want to go for the full-size keyboards
(which will run you \\$120 instead).  You unfortunately don't get the
control key in the right place (in the home row, where it damn well
belongs). Still, keyboards that get this right now cost \\$300. I got
four of these for that price, and I can fix it in post now: it's no
longer 1993 and our operating systems are not entirely broken anymore
(well, at least not in this particular aspect).

Given that other good mechanical keyboards I found cost multiple
hundreds of dollars (and you can easily end up with a \\$500 keyboard if
you go into this rabbit hole), I can't recommend this budget-friendly
Qisan MagicForce enough. I didn't expect to love them nearly as much
as I do.

UPDATE: The Esc-key weirdness is fixable in software by simply typing
Fn-Q. Now hitting the Escape key gives a backtick by default, and
Fn-Esc gives "regular Escape". This is way more ergonomic, since the
Fn key acts uniformly to replace the top row of keys.
