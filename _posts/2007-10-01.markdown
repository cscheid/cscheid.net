While there have been advances in visualization systems, particularly
in multi-view visualizations and visual exploration, the process of
building visualizations remains a major bottleneck in data
exploration. We show that provenance metadata collected during the
creation of pipelines can be reused to suggest similar content in
related visualizations and guide semi-automated changes. We introduce
the idea of query-by-example in the context of an ensemble of
visualizations, and the use of analogies as first-class operations in
a system to guide scalable interactions. We describe an implementation
of these techniques in VisTrails, a publicly-available, open-source
system.
