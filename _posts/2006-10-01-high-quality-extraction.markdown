We propose a new advancing front technique that is capable of creating
high-quality isosurfaces from regular and irregular volumetric
datasets. Our work extends the guidance field framework of Schreiner
et al. to implicit surfaces, and improves it in significant ways. In
particular, we describe a set of sampling conditions that guarantee
that surface features will be captured by the algorithm. We also
describe an efficient technique to compute a minimal guidance field,
which greatly improves performance. Our experimental results show that
our technique can generate high-quality meshes from complex datasets.
