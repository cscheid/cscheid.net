Animated transitions can be effective in explaining and exploring a
small number of visualizations where there are drastic changes in the
scene over a short interval of time. This is especially true if data
elements cannot be visually distinguished by other means. Current
research in animated transitions has mainly focused on linear
transitions (all elements follow straight line paths) or enhancing
coordinated motion through bundling of linear trajectories. In this
paper, we introduce animated transition design, a technique to build
smooth, non-linear transitions for clustered data with either minimal
or no user involvement. The technique is flexible and simple to
implement, and has the additional advantage that it explicitly
enhances coordinated motion and can avoid crowding, which are both
important factors to support object tracking in a scene. We
investigate its usability, provide preliminary evidence for the
effectiveness of this technique through metric evaluations and user
study and discuss limitations and future directions.
