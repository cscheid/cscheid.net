We investigate the influence of bandwidth selection in the
reconstruction quality of point-based surfaces. While the problem has
received relatively little attention in the literature, we show that
appropriate selection plays a significant role in the quality of
reconstructed surfaces. We show how to compute optimal bandwidths for
one class of moving-least squares surfaces by formulating the
polynomial fitting step as a kernel regression problem for both
noiseless and noisy data. In the context of Levin's projection, we
also discuss the implications of the two-step projection for bandwidth
selection. We show experimental comparisons of our method, which
outperforms heuristically chosen functions and weights previously
proposed. We also show the influence of bandwidth on the
reconstruction quality of different formulations of point-based
surfaces. We provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first
quantitative comparisons between different MLS surface formulations
and their optimal bandwidths. Using these experiments, we investigate
the choice of effective bandwidths for these alternative
formulations. We conclude with a discussion of how to effectively
compare the different MLS formulations in the literature.
