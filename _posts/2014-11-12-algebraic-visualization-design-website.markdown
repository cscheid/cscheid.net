title: "Algebraic visualization design website"
---

Gordon and I created a website for our [algebraic visualization
design](http://algebraicvis.net) work. Right now you'll be able to
find a link to the paper, the VIS 2014 presentation, and an
[introduction to the main
ideas](http://algebraicvis.net/2014/11/11/a_primer.html) that follows
the first act of the presentation fairly closely. We will be adding
more content to the website in the future so, if you're interested,
stay tuned!
