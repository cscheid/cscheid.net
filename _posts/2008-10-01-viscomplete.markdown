Building visualization and analysis pipelines is a large hurdle in the
adoption of visualization and workflow systems by domain
scientists. In this paper, we propose techniques to help users
construct pipelines by consensus, automatically suggesting completions
based on a database of previously created pipelines. In particular, we
compute correspondences between existing pipeline subgraphs from the
database, and use these to predict sets of likely pipeline additions
to a given partial pipeline. By presenting these predictions in a
carefully designed interface, users can create visualizations and
other data products more efficiently because they can augment their
normal work patterns with the suggested completions. We present an
implementation of our technique in a publicly-available, open-source
scientific workflow system and demonstrate efficiency gains in
real-world situations.
