title: "Models Matter: my position statement at HILDA 2018"
---

[HILDA](http://hilda.io/2018/) is a great workshop co-located with
[SIGMOD](https://sigmod2018.org/) that aims to bring a human-centric
perspective to data management. 

Juliana, Carsten and Eugene were kind enough to invite me to be on the panel:
[here are the
slides](https://cscheid.net/static/hilda2018/scheidegger-models-matter.pdf)
for my statement.

This year was the first time I attended, and I had a great time: Jock
Mackinlay gave the keynote, and the many stimulating talks were a
great mix of vis, HCI, and data management. I hope I can come back
next year; the rest of SIGMOD, still to come, has a pretty high bar
to clear.
