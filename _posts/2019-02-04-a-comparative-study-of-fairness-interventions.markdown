## Abstract

Computers are increasingly used to make decisions that have
significant impact in peopleâ€™s lives. Often, these predictions can
affect different population subgroups disproportionately. As a result,
the issue of fairness has received much recent interest, and a number
of fairness-enhanced classifiers and predictors have appeared in the
literature. This paper seeks to study the following questions: how do
these different techniques fundamentally compare to one another, and
what accounts for the differences? Specifically, we seek to bring
attention to many under-appreciated aspects of such fairness-enhancing
interventions. Concretely, we present the results of an open benchmark
we have developed that lets us compare a number of different
algorithms under a variety of fairness measures, and a large number of
existing datasets. We find that although different algorithms tend to
prefer specific formulations of fairness preservations, many of these
measures strongly correlate with one another. In addition, we find
that fairness-preserving algorithms tend to be sensitive to
fluctuations in dataset composition (simulated in our benchmark by
varying training-test splits), indicating that fairness interventions
might be more brittle than previously thought.
