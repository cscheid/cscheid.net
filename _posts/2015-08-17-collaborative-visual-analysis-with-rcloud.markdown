Stephen North, Carlos Scheidegger, Simon Urbanek and Gordon
Woodhull. IEEE VAST 2015 (conference track).

Consider the emerging role of data science teams embedded in larger
organizations. Individual analysts work on loosely related problems,
and must share their findings with each other and the organization at
large, moving results from exploratory data analyses (EDA) into
automated visualizations, diagnostics and reports deployed for wider
consumption.

There are two problems with the current practice. First,
there are gaps in this workflow: EDA is performed with one set of
tools, and automated reports and deployments with another. Second,
these environments often assume a single-developer perspective, while
data scientist teams could get much benefit from easier sharing of
scripts and data feeds, experiments, annotations, and automated
recommendations, which are well beyond what traditional version
control systems provide.

We contribute and justify the following three requirements for systems
built to support current data science teams and users:
discoverability, technology transfer, and coexistence. In addition, we
contribute the design and implementation of RCloud, a system that
supports the requirements of collaborative data analysis,
visualization and web deployment. About 100 people used RCloud for two
years. We report on interviews with some of these users, and discuss
design decisions, tradeoffs and limitations in comparison to other
approaches.
