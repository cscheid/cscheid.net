Traditionally, evaluation studies in information visualization have
measured effectiveness by assessing performance time and accuracy.
More recently, there has been a concerted effort to understand aspects
beyond time and errors. In this paper we study enjoyment. While
arguably not the primary goal of visualization, some studies suggest,
through affective priming, that positive emotions can impact
performance and memorability in infovis.  Different models of
enjoyment have been proposed in other fields; yet there is no standard
way to relate the different ways psychologists think about enjoyment
to the ways we evaluate information visualization techniques. In this
paper we attempt to relate the flow model of Csikszentmihalyi to
Munznerâ€™s nested model of visualization evaluation.  Even though
previous papers tackled individual elements of flow, we argue in this
paper that in order to move beyond pure observational studies (and,
critically, produce generalizable results), we ought to understand
what specifically makes a visualization enjoyable, and what level of
the design process these elements affect.
