Hi!

Gordon Kindlmann and I are running a simple user study about images
and color. It takes less than five minutes, and all you need is a web
browser (preferably not on a handheld). We would love it if you could
do the experiment yourself, and send it to other people who you think
might be interested.

The URL is [https://cscheid.net:9999](https://cscheid.net:9999). It's
quick, anonymous, and for the good of visualization research.

Thank you!
