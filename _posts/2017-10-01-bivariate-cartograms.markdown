We describe bivariate cartograms, a technique specifically designed to
allow for the simultaneous comparison of two geo-statistical
variables. Traditional cartograms are designed to show only a single
statistical variable, but in practice, it is often useful to show two
variables (e.g., the total sales for two competing companies)
simultaneously. We illustrate bivariate cartograms using Dorling-style
cartograms, yet the technique is simple and generalizable to other
cartogram types, such as contiguous cartograms, rectangular
cartograms, and non-contiguous cartograms.

Bivariate cartograms make it easy to find more geographic patterns and
outliers in a pre-attentive way than previous approaches. They are
most effective for showing two variables from the same domain (e.g.,
population in two different years, sales for two different companies),
although they can also be used for variables from different domains
(e.g., population and income). We also describe a small-scale
evaluation of the proposed techniques that indicates bivariate
cartograms are especially effective for finding geo-statistical
patterns, trends and outliers.
