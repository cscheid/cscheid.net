Unstructured volume grids are ubiquitous in scientific computing, and
have received substantial interest from the scientific visualization
community. In this paper, we take a point-based approach to rendering
unstructured grids. In particular, we present a novel method of
approximating these irregular elements with point-based primitives
amenable to existing hardware acceleration techniques. To improve
interactivity to large datasets, we have adapted a level-of-detail
strategy. We use a well-known quantitative metric to analyze the image
quality achieved by the final rendering.
