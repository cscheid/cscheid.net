Graphs are often used to encapsulate relationships between objects.
Node-link diagrams, commonly used to visualize graphs, suffer
from visual clutter on large graphs. Edge bundling is an effective
technique for alleviating clutter and revealing high-level edge
patterns. Previous methods for general graph layouts either require a
control mesh to guide the bundling process, which can introduce
high variation in curvature along the bundles, or all-to-all force and
compatibility calculations, which is not scalable. We propose a
multilevel agglomerative edge bundling method based on a principled
approach of minimizing ink needed to represent edges, with
additional constraints on the curvature of the resulting splines. The
proposed method is much faster than previous ones, able to bundle
hundreds of thousands of edges in seconds, and one million edges
in a few minutes.
