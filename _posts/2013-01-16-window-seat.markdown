What does it look like when you turn a video of a 5-hour flight into a
single image?

I finally put together a [web
page](http://cscheid.net/static/windowseat) showing the results of a
fun hack [Bill Cheswick](http://www.cheswick.com) and I worked on in
2011. Bill pointed a GoPro camera out the window of a jetliner, packed
a bunch of extra batteries and high-capacity memory cards, and
recorded the whole thing. By stitching together a single row of pixels
from every frame of the video (the moral equivalent of [slit scan
photography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slit-scan_photography)), you
get a view of the whole continental US. We got lucky it was a mostly
sunny day.
