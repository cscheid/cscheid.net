Visual exploratory analysis of large-scale databases often relies on
precomputed query results in order to guarantee interactivity with the
visualization system. This is especially true when the query requires
joining tables across the database since join is one of the most
computationally expensive operations and in the worst case requires
joining every row of one table to every row of the other
table. Advances in approximate query processing enable quick look
summary statistics, but with limitations to the types and complexities
of the queries. A recent advancement in approximate query processing
is a technique called Wander Join, that performs random walks across
these joins, resulting in faster convergence on aggregation
values. However, this online aggregation technique is not tailored for
visualization tasks that often involve filtering on one or more
conditions or viewing aggregation values across multiple groups such
as in bar charts. In both cases, the convergence rate is slowed since
more samples are needed in order to find records that pass the
filters, resulting in the user waiting longer for a confident result.

To address this issue, we propose a generalization of the Wander Join
algorithm that improves the convergence rate for visualization queries
involving filtering and viewing aggregation. We implemented this
improved version of Wander Join that we call Load-n-Go and compared it
to the original, specifically in the context of visual analysis
tasks. Our evaluation finds that our algorithm outperforms Wander Join
by reducing the sample complexity. Load-n-Go requires up to 50% fewer
samples for group by queries, and up to 85% fewer samples for
filtering queries. Such reduced sampling complexity can represent up
to 2x and 6x speedups respectively for visual exploratory systems
using the Load-n-Go algorithm.
