title: "Nanocubes on Github"

[Nanocubes are now on
Github](http://github.com/laurolins/nanocube)! 

You'll probably want the 1.0 branch, which is the version
we've been demoing. The master branch includes a ton of new goodies
that we'll talk about eventually (although you're welcome to poke at
the source!). 

Documentation is sparse to nonexistent at the moment, but file GitHub
issues! We'll work on them. The license for the project is EPL.
