title: "Voting in the MLB Hall of Fame"

Here's a [visualization of the MLB Hall of Fame](http://bit.ly/Wgqqfz)
trajectories my friend [Kenny
Shirley](http://www2.research.att.com/~kshirley/) and I created using
[D3](http://d3js.org), [R](http://www.r-project.org),
[crossfilter](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/) and a bunch of
elbow grease.

This was a whole lot of fun to create (the whole thing from zero to
published happened in under two weeks), and was a great way to teach
myself some d3. The source code is on
[Github](http://github.com/cscheid/mlb-hall-of-fame-voting).
