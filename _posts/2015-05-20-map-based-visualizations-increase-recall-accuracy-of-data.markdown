We investigate the memorability of data represented in two different
visualization designs. In contrast to recent studies that examine
which types of visual information make visualizations memorable, we
examine the effect of different visualizations on time and accuracy of
recall of the displayed data, minutes and days after interaction with
the visualizations. In particular, we describe the results of an
evaluation comparing the memorability of two different visualizations
of the same relational data: node-link diagrams and map-based
visualization. We find significant differences in the accuracy of the
tasks performed, and these differences persist days after the original
exposure to the visualizations. Specifically, participants in the
study recalled the data better when exposed to map-based
visualizations as opposed to node-link diagrams. We discuss the scope
of the study and its limitations, possible implications, and future
directions.
