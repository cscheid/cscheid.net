The broad goals of verifiable visualization rely on correct
algorithmic implementations. We extend a framework for verification of
isosurfacing implementations to check topological
properties. Specifically, we use stratified Morse theory and digital
topology to design algorithms which verify topological invariants. Our
extended framework reveals unexpected behavior and coding mistakes in
popular publicly-available isosurface codes.
