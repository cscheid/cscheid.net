Topological data analysis is an emerging area in exploratory data
analysis and data mining. Its main tool, persistent homology, has
become a popular technique to study the structure of complex, highdimensional
data. In this paper, we propose a novel method using
persistent homology to quantify structural changes in time-varying
graphs. Specifically, we transform each instance of the time-varying
graph into a metric space, extract topological features using persistent
homology, and compare those features over time. We provide
a visualization that assists in time-varying graph exploration and
helps to identify patterns of behavior within the data. To validate
our approach, we conduct several case studies on real-world datasets
and show how our method can find cyclic patterns, deviations from
those patterns, and one-time events in time-varying graphs. We also
examine whether a persistence-based similarity measure satisfies a
set of well-established, desirable properties for graph metrics.
