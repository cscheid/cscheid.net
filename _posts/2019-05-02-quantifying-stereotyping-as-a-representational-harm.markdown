## Abstract

While harms of allocation have been increasingly studied
as part of the subfield of algorithmic fairness, harms of
representation have received considerably less attention. In
this paper, we formalize two notions of stereotyping and
show how they manifest in later allocative harms within
the machine learning pipeline. We also propose mitigation
strategies and demonstrate their effectiveness on synthetic
datasets.
