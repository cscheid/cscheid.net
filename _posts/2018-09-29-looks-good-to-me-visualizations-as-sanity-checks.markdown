Famous examples such as Anscombeâ€™s Quartet highlight that one of the
core benefits of visualizations is allowing people to discover visual
patterns that might otherwise be hidden by summary statistics. This
visual inspection is particularly important in exploratory data
analysis, where analysts can use visualizations such as histograms and
dot plots to identify data quality issues. Yet, these visualizations
are driven by parameters such as histogram bin size or mark opacity
that have a great deal of impact on the final visual appearance of the
chart, but are rarely optimized to make important features visible.

In this paper, we show that data flaws have varying impact on the
visual features of visualizations, and that the adversarial or merely
uncritical setting of design parameters of visualizations can obscure
the visual signatures of these flaws. Drawing on the framework of
Algebraic Visualization Design, we present the results of a
crowdsourced study showing that common visualization types can appear
to reasonably summarize distributional data while hiding large and
important flaws such as missing data and extraneous modes. We make use
of these results to propose additional best practices for
visualizations of distributions for data quality tasks.
