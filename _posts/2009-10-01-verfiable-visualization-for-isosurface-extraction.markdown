Visual representations of isosurfaces are ubiquitous in the scientific
and engineering literature. In this paper, we present techniques to
assess the behavior of isosurface extraction codes. Where applicable,
these techniques allow us to distinguish whether anomalies in
isosurface features can be attributed to the underlying physical
process or to artifacts from the extraction process. Such scientific
scrutiny is at the heart of verifiable visualization - subjecting
visualization algorithms to the same verification process that is used
in other components of the scientific pipeline. More concretely, we
derive formulas for the expected order of accuracy (or convergence
rate) of several isosurface features, and compare them to
experimentally observed results in the selected codes. This technique
is practical: in two cases, it exposed actual problems in
implementations. We provide the reader with the range of responses
they can expect to encounter with isosurface techniques, both under
"normal operating conditions" and also under adverse
conditions. With the results of the
verification process, practitioners can judiciously select the
isosurface extraction technique appropriate for their problem of
interest, and have confidence in its behavior.
