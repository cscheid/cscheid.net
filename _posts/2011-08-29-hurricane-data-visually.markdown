title: "Hurricane Data, Visually"
---

Nate Silver runs the incredible
[FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com)
blog, currently hosted by the New York Times. Recently, he
[collected
data and ran an analysis](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/29/how-irene-lived-up-to-the-hype/) on whether or not Hurricane Irene has received too
much media attention. I took that data and created some simple plots,
[here](https://cscheid.net/static/20110829/irene.html).

Sorry about not including that content directly here; I'm still working on
integrating ProtoVis and other goodies to my CMS. 

If you have suggestions about the plots or data, let me know in the
comments here!
