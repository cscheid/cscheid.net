After a year and a half, running my blog
on [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.com) started to become
annoying. I just didn't have the control I wanted over the content:
The HTML I sent it tended to change in slightly unpredictable ways,
the theme started to annoy me, and the format was never something I
was very happy with. I maintained both a webpage with (barely) usable
content and a weblog, and it always seemed like the two belonged
together. It was time to move on to something better,
and [cscheid.net](https://cscheid.net) is my first attempt.

The biggest difference you'll see right away is that you can comment
pretty much anywhere around here. So if my code ever breaks, or if
some paragraph in a paper makes no sense, now you know where to
complain! It'll also make it easier for you to let me know if you put
the code to good use, or if you like a paper -- it's always nice to
hear about it.

I want to write a little bit about this new infrastructure; there's
some cool bits about it. I'll also repost some of my favorite content
from the old blog.

[cscheid.net](https://cscheid.net) is fairly unstable at this
point, so I really appreciate any comments about things which break
unexpectedly, things you don't like, or even things which you do like!
