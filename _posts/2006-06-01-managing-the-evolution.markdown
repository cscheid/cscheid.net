*Extended abstract.  VisTrails provides a scientific workflow
infrastructure which can be combined with existing visualization
systems and libraries. A key feature that sets VisTrails apart from
previous visualization as well as scientific workflow systems is the
support for data exploration. By maintaining detailed provenance of
the exploration process --- both within and across different versions
of a dataflow --- it allows scientists to easily navigate through the
space of dataflows created for a given exploration task.
