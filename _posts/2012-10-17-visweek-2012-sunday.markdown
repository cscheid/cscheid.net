title: "VisWeek 2012, Sunday"
---

At this point, [VisWeek 2012](http://ieeevis.org/year/2012/info/call-participation/welcome) is just about
halfway done, and there's tons to write about, but I'll try to keep
these short by sticking to one day at a time. 
VisWeek now runs four parallel tracks for the best part
of a week, so there's no way I can tell you about everything that
is happening out here in (today, surprisingly sunny!) Seattle. But I
will tell you about what I think is cool. The usual caveats follow:
omissions and mischaracterizations are all my fault.

VisWeek started on Sunday, and I saw
[Pat Hanrahan](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~hanrahan/)'s LDAV
keynote on ``Divide and Recombine: an approach for analyzing large
datasets''. This was a nice tour through recent work (some from
Hanrahan and his students, and much from other folks) happening on the big data
community. Pat gave a nice overview of the
reasons surrounding all the buzz around NoSQL databases (performance!
flexibility! distributed computation!), and the challenges
for visualization and data analyst researchers and practitioners:
mostly, the toolchain is slow and clunky. And [computer scientists are
toolsmiths](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~brooks/Toolsmith-CACM.pdf), so we should make [better](https://github.com/jtalbot/riposte)
[tools](http://www.datadr.org).

It was fun to realize that his talk was really about
``satellite issues'' surrounding the topics which we traditionally
consider visualization, such as: how can we get to the big data
sources? How do we wrangle all that data into something usable for
visualization, and how do we manage (computationally, and organizationally)
all the analyses which we need to use to get meaningful visualizations?
Much of his talk focused
on [R](http://www.r-project.org), the current darling language
of data analysts. Interestingly, across the hall to this talk,
[a
tutorial on ggplot2 and ggobi](http://ieeevis.org/year/2012/tutorial/visweek/visualizing-data-r-and-ggobi) was being presented by Di Cook, Heike Hofmann (of whom I'll
have more to say soon). ggplot2 has been described as the hipster
plotting library for R. But it really does kick ass. Of course, 
I'm partial to R since I work in the same building as some
good
folks
who are deeply involved with it. Nevertheless, it's nice to see the
VisWeek community warming up to it,
[warts
and all](https://twitter.com/FisherDanyel/status/257524247105253376).

The other interesting observation Pat Hanrahan made was that
problems which the (for lack of a better term) ``industrial big data
community'' tackle have a lot of overlap with the ones which we
tackle at VisWeek. Somewhat inexplicably, there is minimal overlap of the
communities: how many of us hang out at
[Strata](http://strataconf.com/stratany2012/?intcmp=il-strata-stny12-franchise-page),
or the many great
[visualization](https://www.facebook.com/events/152674571526368/)
and [statistical computing](http://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/)
meetups? It's something to think about. 

At the same time, someone mentioned to me tonight that in the user
interface community, there is an analogous situation with
[UX](http://www.ux-lx.com)
vs. [CHI](http://chi2013.acm.org). So is this simply an
indication that visualization is now actually mainstream? In other
words, is this fragmentation a symptom of success or an admission
of defeat? I don't know.

## Plug: come see our panel!

I have a lot more to say about VisWeek 2012, but the bigger the wall
of text, the more likely you are to go look at
[cute cats](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww). So before you leave, let me plug
a panel in which (because unfortunately [Juliana Freire](http://vgc.poly.edu/~juliana/) can't make the trip) I will be presenting, about
[reproducible
visualization research](http://ieeevis.org/year/2012/panel/infovis/reproducible-visualization-research-how-do-we-get-there). This is a topic near and dear to my heart, so
I am really honored (and more than a little scared) to be sharing the
stage with [Tim Dwyer](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~tdwyer/),
[Tamara Munzner](www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/) and
[Gordon Kindlmann](http://cs.uchicago.edu/~glk/). There's few
things I like better than a good argument, so this should be great fun.
