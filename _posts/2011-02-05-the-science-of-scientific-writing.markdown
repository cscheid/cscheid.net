title: "The Science of Scientific Writing"
---

I have recently received a large amount of excellent writing advice,
and I want to share some of it with you. Among other things, I was
told to read
[The
Science of Scientific Writing](http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/the-science-of-scientific-writing), by George Gopen and Judith Swan. Being
told that you suck is great; you get to learn so much from it!

I know I'm not the best writer. I have read my good share of writing
advice, and although I have gotten better at throwing away needless
words, the structure of the sentences I write always feels clunky. To
make matters worse, I had no idea why that happens. But now that I
have read some of what the authors have to say, I am no longer
entirely clueless. Gopen and Swan argue that good writing is about successfully managing
the expectations of readers. That by itself would be little more than
a truism. Unlike much that is written about writing, however,
this article actually gives concrete ways to improve your own sentences. Here is an
excerpt:

"We now have three rhetorical principles based on reader
expectations. First, grammatical subjects should be followed as soon
as possible by their verbs; second, every unit of discourse, no matter
the size, should serve a single function or make a single point; and,
third, information intended to be emphasized should appear at points
of syntactic closure."

This third principle was a true eye-opener to me. Gopen and Swan claim that
readers spend more mental energy on the "stress position" of a
sentence. According to them, this stress position "coincides with the
moment of syntactic closure. A reader has reached the beginning of the
stress position when she knows there is nothing left in the clause or
sentence but the material being presently read". In other words, the
important clause in your sentence should be placed where the
syntax of this clause is entirely determined by what came before
it. When your sentences are written in this way, the reader's effort
is naturally directed at the point you're trying to make, and not at
the structure of the sentence. That is brilliant advice.

I urge you to go and read the whole thing. When you are done, you will
probably want to know that Gopen has written an entire book on this topic, called
[The Sense of Structure: Writing from a Reader's Perspective](http://www.amazon.com/Sense-Structure-Writing-Readers-Perspective/dp/0205296327/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1296888023&sr=8-1). 

Incidentally, there must be a link between what Gopen and Swan say
about writing and our theories about how people understand
visualizations; I have to learn more about this!
