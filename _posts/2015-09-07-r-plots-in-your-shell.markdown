The [latest beta of iterm2](http://www.iterm2.com) supports inline
images by [extending the xterm
protocol](http://www.iterm2.com/images.html) (the 1337 escape code
hasn't escaped notice. Nice) This means you can high five yourself on
the shell:

!(/assets/img/shell_high_five.jpg)

(And, by the way, that is an animated high-five)
It also means you can easily plot your data from the shell:

!(/assets/img/rplot.jpg)

Details at the [github repo](http://github.com/cscheid/rplot).
