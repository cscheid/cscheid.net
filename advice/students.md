So we're going to work together. That's great! I wrote this thing to
help us both get started. 

All of the [general academic advice](academics.html) I wrote applies, and
then there's this.

## "What is going on inside his head?"

At this point I've interacted with more students than you have with
research supervisors. And I've been a student before, but you (I don't
think!) haven't been a research supervisor before. These give me
better odds of knowing what's going on in your head, research-wise,
than you knowing what's in mine. I'm writing this to give you a better
idea of where I'm coming from.

As we work together, I will try hard to understand where you're coming
from, and try to make it clear to you where I'm coming from. We'll do
well together to the extent that we know what one another's thinking,
and that we both expect the same things to happen.

The general rule for our interactions should be the following. If you
don't understand something, *think*, *google*, and *ask me about it*.

## let's decide on a problem

When we get to work on some problem, it should be something that makes
you excited. If you don't like a particular research problem, *tell me
about it*. I will do my best to supply enthusiasm, but if you are not
enthusiastic about it yourself, I won't be much help.

## day-to-day

My job is to help you become a good researcher. I want you to become
independent and go forth and learn and discover and build amazing
things (because I want you to teach them to me later!). But in the
process, you will get tripped up, make mistakes, get stuck and be
generally overwhelmed. After you are a good researcher, you will
still get tripped up, make mistakes, get stuck and be generally
overwhelmed. But I hope to have prepared you for some of it.  It's not
that I'm trying to scare you. It's that I've been there, I
understand what you're going through. Research advising is a mix of *idea
gardening* ("try this, not that"), gym coach ("I'm sure you can push
yourself harder than that: don't hold back") and support network
("yes, this paper got rejected, but trust me, it's good work. Let's
keep at it").

When I started doing research, I had no idea how important
*perseverance* is. Good research is equal amounts intelligence and
grit. You already have plenty of the former (you would not be here
otherwise), and the good news is that we can train you for the
latter. But don't underestimate the extent to which continued work on
a single hard problem can be emotionally draining.

This is why I want to meet with you regularly, why I want to hear
from you regularly. I want to know if you're getting frustrated, and
I don't want you to get burned out. In addition, *steady work is
better than spiky work*. We cannot help that progress is usually
spiky, but we can (and should!) have steady effort instead of spiky
effort. Deadlines and milestones are
[beautiful motivators](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/what-good-marathons-and-bad-investments-have-in-common.html?_r=0),
but they're also the easiest way to burn out.

When we meet, you should expect a lively discussion. That's because I
want our mistakes and bad ideas to show up sooner rather than
later. You should also bring a written document describing what you
tried, what worked, and what didn't, and what's getting you
stuck. Make an effort to write these things down as they are
happening, and not an hour before the meeting: the process of writing
down is a great way to help your thinking (this has been reinvented
many times in the past: you might know it as [rubber-duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging))

If you're getting started in research, you will have read more
research papers than written them. That might give you the impression
the research process is neat and orderly, like the structure of a good
paper: we think of a problem, we find related work, come up with a new
idea, test it, and then think of what's next.
Well, it's nothing like that. It's messy:
we know where we want to go, but we do not really know how to get
there (that's the point!). Matt Might has a famous, great
[illustrated guide to a PhD](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/),
which I will only nitpick in one way. Navigating towards boundary feel
more
[like this](http://boingboing.net/2010/02/09/deep-zoom-into-mande.html).
It also feels as great as that looks: noticing something no one else
has noticed before, in the middle of all this mess, is a *huge rush*. 
But as you maybe already know, I
(and you, and everyone else, including true
[geniuses](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/879/most-interesting-mathematics-mistake/921#921))
make a *lot* of mistakes, and so it's important to not let the
excitement get us ahead of the truth. I want you to become comfortable
at staring at ideas (both mine and your own) that you want to be true,
and learning to spot the ones that are not[^1].

In addition, when *you* are navigating towards the unknown, the
unknown is unknown to *me* too! So, inevitably in the course of your studies,
your job will be to teach me, because by definition, no one else will
have been where you are. Wild, huh? What this means is that I can
teach you how to succesfully "live on the edge", but you should expect
to know things that I don't, and that you will need to make an effort
to explain them to me.

## workflow, or command-line bullshittery

I'm stealing the section title from Philip Guo's
[excellent, *excellent*](http://www.pgbovine.net/command-line-bullshittery.htm)
writeup (I'm not going to hold it against you if you leave now and go
read everything Guo has written. Seriously).

It is maybe a bit embarassing that the best way
we know how to carry our day-to-day research is by interacting with
computers through a command-line interface that's been the same for,
more or less, 40 years. But them's the breaks, so my job is to make it
as easy as possible for you to get used to it yourself.

You will need to learn either [git](http://git-scm.com/) or
[mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/). We are going to use
version control to share source code, paper manuscripts, and possibly
data. Dropbox is nice, but when the time of a paper deadline arrives,
we will want to be editing the same files at the same time. We want to
avoid the dreadful "who has the writing token?" emails, and, even more
so, we want to avoid the
"paper\_version1\_ab\_november\_please\_stop.tex" madness. Distributed
version-control systems are *wonderful* for that.

Speaking of papers, you will need to learn
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/). You will be writing a lot, and
although there is a lot that's bad about LaTeX, there's so much more
that's good.

You will need to learn one of the standard UNIX shells: `bash`,
`tcsh`, `zsh`, or whatever you like. If you use Windows on a
day-to-day basis, I will not be able to help you with your workflow. I
have been bitten by proprietary software way too many times in the
past; even though I run OS X primarily, the stuff I depend on for
research is all open source.

I don't care what programming language you use for your software, but
it will make things much smoother if we speak the same ones.  C++,
Python, and Javascript are what I use on a day-to-day basis (in no
particular order), but I speak a little Haskell, Scheme, Julia, OCaml,
Java, and a handful of others. It's much more important for you to be
very proficient with one language than to write in whatever is the new
hotness, but if you're a fan of some particularly cool programming
language, tell me about it!

You can use an IDE for developing your code if you like, but if you do
so, I will want you to make sure everything builds from the
command-line (ideally from a single Makefile, but I'll take `ant`,
`scons`, `autotools`, `CMake`, or something like that). I'm happy to
share with you whatever little Emacs I've picked up over the years,
and if you know vi, I want to learn!

## back up your files. Back. up. your. files.

Don't lose a month of writing because someone stole your
laptop, or because some idiot walking past you at the coffee shop
decided it was time to plaster your keyboard with caffeine.

Everything that is important about your research should be saved in a
system that's backed up, *automatically*, by someone other than
yourself (emailing files to yourself does not count). Dropbox is not backup,
[unless you pay for the packrat option](https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/113). For
example, have a [cron job that rsyncs](#command-line-bullshittery)
your contents with the university machines, or run CrashPlan, or
*something*. I will ask you about your backups.

# requests

It's an integral part of my job to help you succeed. You should ask me
about anything you feel comfortable asking. Still, here's some things
to keep in mind.

## recommendation letters

Good recommendation letters are tremendously important for your
success, and I'll be happy to write them for you. But know that bad
recommendation letters hurt more than good recommendation letters
help. I can only give you a good recommendation letter if we have
worked together in the past. Also, recommendation letters take time to
write! I would prefer that you tell me about the letter a month in
advance, possibly more. You should still reach out to me if you're
short on time, but you should have a backup plan in that case.

[^1]: Take the [famous story by Feynman about Wheeler](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/feynman-lecture.html) (the paragraph starts with "as a by-product..."). Wheeler suggests to Feynman that the reason all electrons have the same mass is that *they are the same electron*. This is beautiful, and, that's why positrons exists: *they are just the same electron going back in time*. But wait, says Feynman, in that case the direction of time can't matter, so why do we see more electrons than positrons? Wheeler tries to salvage the idea but no, it doesn't really work. At the same time, the idea that a positron is indistinguishable to an electron when you flip time *does* work. Moral: be willing to attack any idea. Good ideas survive, and bad ideas can be turned into good ones.
