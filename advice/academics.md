Collected advice on the mechanics of academia. Things I tell other people,
should they ask, and things I tell myself, should I forget. Things
specific to student-advisor [are to be found here](students.html).

*Caveats*: this is all personal perspective, in case it's not
obvious enough by the fourth paragraph. I found it
had a positive impact in how I go about my work, and I think it
could help other people. It's neither exhaustive or
unchanging. 

## Generalities

I try to read Hamming's
["You and Your Research"](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)
once a year. Pay attention to the "work more" bit, but ignore the part
about stress and ulcers: it's useless chest-thumping. Work on
important problems, steadily; don't fret if you see a contradiction:
learn to keep conflicting views in your head; keep your doors open,
literally; learn to sell.

Someone once told me that the only questions you should ask a
researcher are "what is the most important problem in your area?",
followed by "what are you doing about it?".


## Academics is about building a better, shared understanding of something

Sometimes the best way to make an academic point in computer science
is to build software; often you need to build something in other to
understand it. But the questions are always of understanding, *why*
and *how*: why does this matter? why is it bad? how can it be
improved, and why?

The way I see it, academia exists to improve how *people*
*understand* things. Each of these is actually important, and helps
unpack how other important things are not academic.

If I understand something better than everyone else but I fail to
communicate that to other people, then I'm not a good academic (I pass
the "understand", but not the "people").

If I deeply care about doing something and sharing it with the world,
but it doesn't help understanding things better, than I'm not a good
academic ("people", but not "understand").

So in an academic setting, you will be spending equal amounts of
effort trying to understand things, and trying to find ways to make
other people around you understand things the same way you do. Of
course, other academics are doing precisely the same thing, so you
will also spend time trying to see the world the way they do, *if only
so that you can explain to them why yours is better in a way they can
see it*.

### Writing

At some point in time I used to recommend
[Strunk and White's Element of Style](http://www.powells.com/biblio/17-9780205309023-9),
together with pretty much every other piece of writing advice you'll
find online. But it turns out it's
[not](http://chronicle.com/article/50-Years-of-Stupid-Grammar/25497)
[such](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1498) [great advice](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2235). S&W was the
first thing I read when I started caring about my own writing, and my
writing did improve after reading it. On a third or fourth
reading, though, I started noticing that S&W is contradictory and
sanctimonious ("be clear". Well, duh. But how?). So what should you
read?

Start with Gopen and Swan's
[Science of Scientific Writing](https://www.americanscientist.org/blog/the-long-view/the-science-of-scientific-writing):
it's short, sweet and it actually explains *why* you should write in
any particular way. Then go on to buy Gopen's
[Sense of Structure](http://www.powells.com/biblio/62-9780205296323-1),
and Williams's
[Style: Toward Clarity and Grace](http://www.amazon.com/Style-Clarity-Chicago-Writing-Publishing/dp/0226899152).

If you're interested in how language works, you will love
(although you probably already do) the
[Language Log](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/).

The
[Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780226104201-8)
is handy for grammar questions, but take it as a descriptive grammar
reference, not as a manual of style.


### The research paper

Research communication currently happens primarily through
papers. This is where you show the world that 

1. you understand how the field got to where it is
2. what you see to be a problem
3. what you're doing about it
4. why it works

#### The context of a paper

The "context" of the paper is all the stuff, roughly, about where you
connect with the expectations of the community reading the paper.
Remember that you are writing your paper *for other people*, who have
some set of ideas in their heads, likely somewhat distinct from
yours. The introduction, discussion, and related work sections are
where you get to make these connections. Pay attention to these
sections!

#### The content of a paper

When it comes to the content of the paper, the platonic ideal is
that every bit of it should either be 

1. a theorem, a proof, or an argument
2. an experiment, a description thereof
3. a statement followed by a citation

The basic rule is: anything you say in the content of the paper (that
is, the actual things you have done, discovered, or invented) needs to
be substantiated. Theoretical things require arguments and formal
proofs, experimental things require experiment descriptions, and
anything else requires citations.

This is, incidentally, a simple way to remove fat from a writeup.

#### Unlearning bad habits

Since you'll do a whole lot of reading before you actually do any
writing, chances are you'll pick up writing ticks and idiosyncrasies,
and you'll tend to repeat them (I know I do, and I'm still
unlearning). There are a lot of bad habits in math and computer
science. Pay attention to what [Shewchuk says](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jrs/sins.html).

#### Be careful with what you write, even on drafts.

Sometimes bad things slip past proofreading. And peer review. And they
end up
[on twitter](https://twitter.com/davidjayharris/status/531927801037729792). Do
not make this mistake. As so many wise mothers say, if you cannot say
something nice, say nothing at all. This goes twice as strongly for
the written word. One of the hardest things you will ever do as an
academic is to learn to resist the temptation to be negative. There's
plenty of bad writing and bad research out there, don't get me
wrong. But in a few years you will go back and read some of your own
papers and realize that they are not the masterpieces you once
thought they were. Remember that when you find a bad paper.

#### What's a non-native speaker to do?

[The Corpus of Contemporary American English](http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/).

### Reading

Do not think that you have to read the entire textbook, paper, or
even section. Find the right *algorithm*, *sentence*, *theorem*, or *proof*
you want to understand, and then make sure you understand *everything*
about it. 
Fight the words that you're reading: are they really true? How would you tell?
Can you prove it? To yourself? To a friend? To a reviewer?
What happens if you change the words one way or another? Is it
obvious? Is it a new paper waiting to be written?

It's far more important to know how to go find the right resource than
to read everything from beginning to end.

### Reviewing

You will over the course of your career review many things. Remember
this very important rule: in very few occasions you will be reviewing
people.

If you are reviewing a paper, it is never *the authors* that are
wrong; rather, you only know that the *paper* might be wrong. Before
submitting every review, make sure you check what you wrote. Very
rarely you should need to write "author". If you can't fight the urge,
at least save "author" for praising, and "paper" for criticizing.

This is a matter of making the process less of a personal judgment,
but it is also a matter of making it more precise: you truly do not
know if this was just a screwup. And writeup screwups that look bad
do happen. I've made many of them myself, and you'll make them too.

Hence, making your reviews about the paper and not about the authors
is a good habit to get into: it makes your review much more likely to
be listened to, and it focuses your thinking on those things that
matter. 

Here's a neat trick I learned: the
[principle of charity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity)
also works as a great source of ideas. If the manuscript is wrong, you
can tell the authors how to fix it. They will be thankful for it, you
will have helped make the world a better place, and will have worked
towards leveling up your
["turn bad ideas into good ones" skill](http://xkcd.com/189/).
