Collected advice on mechanics of academia. Things I tell other people,
should they ask, and things I tell myself, should I forget.

## Generalities

I try to read Hamming's
["You and Your Research"](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)
once a year. Pay attention to the "work more" bit, but ignore the
stress and ulcers chest-thumping. Work on important problems,
steadily; don't fret if you see a contradiction, learn to keep
conflicting views in your head; keep your doors open, literally; learn
to sell.

Someone once told me that the only questions you should ask a
researcher are "what is the most important problem in your area?",
followed by "what are you doing about it?".

## Writing

At some point in time I used to recommend
[Strunk and White's Element of Style](http://www.powells.com/biblio/17-9780205309023-9),
together with pretty much every other piece of writing advice you'll
find online. But it turns out it's
[not](http://chronicle.com/article/50-Years-of-Stupid-Grammar/25497)
[such](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1498) [great]
[advice](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2235). S&W was the
first thing I read when I started caring about my own writing, and my
writing did improve after reading it. But on a third or fourth
reading, I started noticing that S&W is contradictory and
sanctimonious ("be clear". Well, duh. But how?). So what should you
read?

Start with Gopen and Swan's
[Science of Scientific Writing](http://engineering.missouri.edu/civil/files/science-of-writing.pdf):
it's short, sweet and it actually explains *why* you should write in
any particular way. Then go on to buy Gopen's
[Sense of Structure](http://www.powells.com/biblio/62-9780205296323-1),
and Williams's
[Style: Toward Clarity and Grace](http://www.amazon.com/Style-Clarity-Chicago-Writing-Publishing/dp/0226899152).

If you're interested at all in how language works, you should be
reading (although you probably already are) the
[Language Log](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/).

The
[Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780226104201-8)
is handy for grammar questions, but take it as a descriptive grammar
reference, not as a manual of style.

### Papers

Research communication currently happens primarily through
papers. This is where you show the world that 

1. you understand how the field got to where it is
2. what you see to be a problem
3. what you're doing about it

#### The context of a paper

TBD.

#### The content of a paper

When it comes to the content of the paper, the platonic ideal is
that every bit of should either be 

1. a theorem, a proof, or an argument
2. an experiment, a description thereof
3. a statement followed by a citation

The basic rule is: anything you say in the content of the paper (that
is, the actual things you have done, discovered, or invented) needs to
be substantiated. Theoretical things require arguments and formal
proofs, experimental things require experiment descriptions, and
anything else require citations.

This is, incidentally, a simple way to remove fat from a writeup.

## Reading

Do not think that you have to read the entire textbook, paper, or
even section. Find the right *theorem*, *proof* or *sentence* to
understand, but then make sure you understand *everything* about it. Fight
the words you're reading: are they really true? How would you tell?
Can you prove it? To yourself? To a friend? To a reviewer?
What happens if you change the words one way or another? Is it
obvious? Is it a new paper waiting to be written?

It's far more important to know how to go find the right resource than
to read everything from beginning to end.

## Reviewing

You will over the course of your career review many things. Remember
this very important rule: in very few occasions you will be reviewing
people. If you are reviewing a paper, it is not *the authors* that
might be wrong: it's the *paper*. This is a good habit to get into:
even if you are correct in pointing out a problem, the readers of your
review are much more likely to pay attention to what you are saying if
you do not make it personal.
