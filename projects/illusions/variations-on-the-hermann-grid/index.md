# Variations on the Hermann grid

The [Hermann grid](https://www.illusionsindex.org/i/hermann-grid) is the prototypical example of the extinction
illusion. Here we build a small variation of Figure 5 from [Ninio and
Stevens's Variations on the Hermann Grid: An Extinction Illusion](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/p2985).
There are equally many points on either half of the image: the animation simply moves the points vertically.

I found out about the static version of this illusion [on twitter](https://twitter.com/chazfirestone/status/1049312925134020610).
