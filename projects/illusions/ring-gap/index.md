# Rotating ring gap

This is a continuous version of the [purple dots
illusion](../purple-dots/). Keep staring at the
crosshairs. Eventually, instead of a white gap rotating, you'll start
seeing a bright band of the opponent color.

Incidentally, you'll notice that this opponent color is quite bright -
it in fact appears brighter than the white background of your display!
This is because you're experiencing a [Chimerical
color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color).

# Acknowledgements

I'm sure this has been discovered before, but I came up with this
particular version.
