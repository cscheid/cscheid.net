# Projects

Vis projects, small hacks, etc. Presented in no particular order.

* 2018-02-21 - [Scales Playground](d3-scale-playground/) - A playground to explore the
  behavior of different d3 scales.
* [Optical Illusions](illusions/)
* 2016-11-20 - The [Fagan Nomogram](fagan_nomogram/) is a great way to get better
  intuition for simple cases of Bayes's Theorem.
* 2016-11-19 - The [Bunimovich stadium](bunimovich_stadium/) is a neat dynamical
  system.
* 2016-11-12 - An illustration of the
  [duality principle](/writing/data_science/duality.html) in (convex) optimization.
* 2016-10-11 - An illustration of how
  [a 2x2 symmetric matrix transforms vectors via the eigendecomposition](https://cscheid.net/courses/fal16/cs444/lectures/lecture15/eigenvectors.html).
* 2016-09-15 - Color spaces: interpolation in RGB, HSL, and Lab color spaces looks
  [quite different](/courses/fal16/cs444/demos/colorscale_visualizer)
  from each other.
  
  
## Older stuff

* If you take pictures of clouds from an airplane, you can see [their
  3D structure](http://cscheid.net/to/clouds.html).
* The set roots of polynomials with small integer coefficients has some
  [incredible structure](http://cscheid.github.io/lux/demos/beauty_of_roots/beauty_of_roots.html)
* If you stitch together 4 hours of an intercontinental flight, you
  get an interesting [map of the US](/static/windowseat).
* An exploration of the
  [MLB Hall of Fame voting patterns](http://cscheid.net/static/mlb-hall-of-fame-voting/).
* A funny-looking, but mathematically-sound, [interactive nomograph for
  computing Bayes's Rule](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~cscheid/blog/20080420/f4.svg).
