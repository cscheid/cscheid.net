# Assignment 3: Project Proposal

- Posting date: Feb 6th 2019.
- Due date: Feb 13th 2019, 11:59 MST.
- Github Classroom Link: [Assignment 3](https://classroom.github.com/a/au0SpSrh).

## Assignment description

In this assignment, you will produce a written document that will
serve as your proposal for your final project. You will follow the format
of the document `proposal.tex` in the starter repository, which asks you
to answer a series of questions about your final project.

At this step of the project, you are producing a **proposal
document**. I reserve the right to tell you the propose a different
project if I do not believe your project has adequate scope for the
class. Specifically, my feedback to you will include explicit verbiage
on whether you are allowed to go ahead and proceed with your plans as
described in the document, or whether you should make changes and
resubmit the proposal.

## Possible final projects

Your final project is intended to be the open-ended part of the
course, where you will have the opportunity (and expectation) to
engage more deeply with some aspect of the machine learning field.


### Complete a self-contained, research-oriented subproject of your choosing

This is an attractive option if you are already engaged in research in
your own field of study. Here, you will propose to deliver a project
that will help you move your own work forward, and this project will
involve machine learning in some sense.


### Implement a paper from the literature

Alternatively, you can find a recent paper from the machine learning
literature (ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, KDD, FAT*, etc) and implement it
yourself.  Note that I will not allow you to choose a paper that has
an existing, popular implementation (if the research project that led to the publication includes an implementation, then it's
unlikely that I will allow your project)


### Other projects I am personally interested in

* The literature in [Fairness, Accountability and
  Transparency](https://www.fatconference.org/) in ML has recently
  exploded, and it would be quite interesting to perform a study of
  the field based on natural language processing. This would likely be a
  combination of a literature review, some qualitative coding, and NLP
  techniques.
  
* In collaboration with [other
  colleagues](http://fairness.haverford.edu), I have developed a
  [Python
  package](https://github.com/algofairness/fairness-comparison) for
  comparing different ML algorithms with respect to their fairness
  properties. In this project, you would implement some recent "fair
  ML" algorithm, and integrate it with this Python package above.


### Anything you can convince me is interesting enough

Your proposal should be substantive and on-topic for a final project
in this class (remember that I reserve the right to have you
repropose).  Nevertheless, this is the category for those of you with
a burning idea in your head, on which you'd like to work on for a
continued period of time.



# Starter repo

The starter repository in this case includes a LaTeX file
(`proposal.tex`) with a skeleton of the document you will use to
propose your project. You will submit a file `proposal.pdf` compiled
from that document.

## LaTeX help

If you need help with LaTeX, please contact me sooner rather than
later.
