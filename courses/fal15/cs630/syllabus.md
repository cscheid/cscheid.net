# CSC 630 - Systems for Interactive Data Analysis

When data sources get large enough, no single analysis or
visualization can convey all the structure and information that might
be there. We need *interactive interfaces*: computer programs to help
us build models and visualizations progressively. In this
research-oriented seminar, we will spend most of the class time
discussing recent research results in the area, typically in the form
of conference and journal papers. The questions we will tackle are:
how can we build these systems? How do we know they work? Can they
mislead us, and how? How do they fit with the rest of the data
analysis infrastructure? Although our research focus will be in
visualization, we will cover a mix of algorithms, systems, data
mining, machine learning, and whatever other computer science topics
become necessary as our discussion progresses. Students will be
assessed on their class participation, paper summary reports, and
research projects.

# Course Objectives and Expected Learning Outcomes

This is a research seminar. We will spend most class time presenting
and discussing research papers in the area. Time spent outside of
lectures will be split between reading relevant literature and working
towards producing research in the area.

A successful CSC630 student will understand the state of the art in
interactive data analysis, the constraints and limitations of the
current solutions, and the most promising research avenues. An ideal
CSC630 will have produced a significant portion of a research project.
Specifically, if you're a student and are hoping to become my M.Sc. or
Ph.D. student, I expect you to excel at this course.

Students will produce short written reports about research papers as
we read them. I will assess learning outcomes by reading these paper
reports and providing written feedback. 
 
# Topics

* Present practice in interactive data analysis
* Limitations: where do things break down?
* Current and previous avenues of attack
  * what worked? what didn't? have we learned anything?
* TBD: Paper list and research projects

# Course Format and Teaching Methods

The course will be entirely paper presentations and discussions. 

I will present the first few papers to set the tone for the
course. After this, students will present the majority of subsequent
work. I will lead the discussion and provide additional background
material when necessary, but my role will be primarily of mediator and
enabler: students are expected to actively participate in the course.

Students will be assessed on their in-class presentations and
discussion, together with written paper reports.
 
# Required and Recommended Texts

There is no required textbook: the reading material for the course
will consist entirely of research papers in the area, and the papers
we will discuss will be made available on the website.

All materials made available by the instructor or The University of
Arizona remain the property of the copyright holders.  They are
provided for the use of students in this course for the duration of
the course, except as noted.

# Required or Special Materials
 
Recommended knowledge levels: a mature, broad understanding of
computer science as expected of first-year graduate students. During
the progress of the course, we will touch upon a variety of material,
from database systems to machine learning and statistics. Students are
not expected to know these areas in depth, but *are* expected to learn
relevant information in a as-needed basis. 

In other words, if you don't know enough to understand a paper, you
are expected to look up additional information about it. 

*Learning how to navigate an unexplored research area is part of the
 skill set I expect students to develop during this course*. I will
 help students get there, but independence and self-direction
 are very valuable: expect to be challenged in this area.

# Grading Policy

Please refer to the university policy
[regarding grades and grading systems](​http://catalog.arizona.edu/2015-16/policies/grade.htm)

accordance with university policies linked above.

How many points assigned to each activity including relative percentage in relation to final grade

## Weightings

TBD.

## Evaluation criteria

Assignment/Testing Schedule/Due Dates TBD.

Assignments with description TBD.

# Late Work Policy 

As a rule, work will not be accepted late except in
case of documented emergency or illness. You may petition the
professor in writing for an exception if you feel you have a
compelling reason for turning work in late.
 
# Attendance Policy

Please refer to UA's [policy concerning Class Attendance and Administrative Drops](http://catalog.arizona.edu/2015-16/policies/classatten.htm).

Participating in the course and attending lectures and other course
events are vital to the learning process.  As such, attendance is
required at all lectures and discussion section meetings.  Students
who miss class due to illness or emergency are required to bring
documentation from their healthcare provider or other relevant,
professional third parties.  Failure to submit third-party
documentation will result in unexcused absences.
  
In addition, refer to UA's policy [regarding absences on and accommodation of religious
holidays](http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/policies-and-codes/accommodation-religious-observance-and-practice).

## Dean's Excuses

Quoting from [the FAQ](https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/faqs):

> A Dean’s Excuse provides excused absences for university-sponsored
> events/activities for academic, non-academic, and recognized student
> organizations. If a student must miss a class or classes for a
> university-sponsored event, the faculty or staff responsible for that
> event request a UA Official Activity Excused Absence Request Form from
> the Dean of Students Office.
> 
> The Dean of Students Office does not have oversight of academic
> departments or faculty members and does not grant individual excused
> absences. Each faculty member manages his or her classroom in the
> manner in which they see fit and are the only ones who may determine
> what constitutes an excused absence.  Therefore, we are unable to
> excuse absences for students, grant extensions, require that
> professors allow students to make-up missed work, or ensure students
> may miss class and submit late work without penalty, etc.
> 
> The best thing to do is for you to communicate directly with your
> professor regarding your absence.  Your professor is the only person
> who can excuse your absence, and determine if alternatives or
> make-up work is an option.  Your professor may also request
> documentation of your situation.  If your professor will not excuse
> your absence or grant make-up work the Dean of Students Office is
> not able to require them to do so.

# Assignment Format

Paper report assignments will be short research reports (around 2
pages of 12-point single-column text) describing the papers being
discussed, and putting the papers in context of other research in the
area.

The final project report will be a longer research report: think of it
as a first draft of a research paper describing your contribution to
the field of interactive data analysis. Although the development of
novel software is a valuable part of research, the ultimate outcome is
to *communicate a novel idea*: software, in this case, is a means to
an end. If you don't achieve the end, you will be graded accordingly.

# Code of Conduct

The Arizona Board of Regents' Student Code of Conduct, ABOR Policy
5-308, prohibits threats of physical harm to any member of the
University community, including to one's self. Please refer to
[the full Code of Conduct](http://azregents.asu.edu/rrc/Policy%20Manual/5-308-Student%20Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf)
document for details.

The Department of Computer Science’s Code of Conduct requires the
following of all students, teaching assistants, staff and faculty:

- We treat each other respectfully always, everywhere.
- We refrain from boastful behavior.
- We encourage each other’s success.

Students who violate this code will be asked to cease and, possibly,
reported to the Dean of Students.

To foster a positive learning environment, students may not text,
chat, make phone calls, play games, read the newspaper, or surf the
web during lecture and discussion.  Students are asked to refrain from
disruptive conversations with people sitting around them during
lecture.  Students observed engaging in disruptive activity will be
asked to cease this behavior.  Students who continue to disrupt the
class will be asked to leave lecture or discussion and may be reported
to the Dean of Students.

# Classroom Electronics

Some learning styles are best served by using personal electronics,
such as laptops and iPads.  These devices can be distracting to some
learners.  Therefore, people who prefer to use electronic devices for
note-taking during lecture should use one side of the classroom.
 
# Accessibility and Accommodations

It is the University’s goal that learning experiences be as accessible
as possible.  If you anticipate or experience physical or academic
barriers based on disability, please let me know immediately so that
we can discuss options.  You are also welcome to contact Disability
Resources (520-621-3268) to establish reasonable accommodations.  For
additional information on Disability Resources and reasonable
accommodations, please visit the
[Disability Resources](http://drc.arizona.edu/) website.

If you have reasonable accommodations, please plan to meet with me by
appointment or during office hours to discuss accommodations and how
my course requirements and activities may impact your ability to fully
participate.

Please be aware that the accessible table and chairs in this room
should remain available for students who find that standard classroom
seating is not usable.
 
# Student Code of Academic Integrity

Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely
the principles and applications of course materials. However, graded
work/exercises must be the product of independent effort unless
otherwise instructed. Students are expected to adhere to the
[UA Code of Academic Integrity as described in the UA General Catalog](http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/policies-and-codes/code-academic-integrity).

- Students may not discuss individual homework with anybody other than the instructors and teaching assistants.
- Students may not share individual homework solutions with anybody.
- Students may post questions to Piazza, but should refrain from posting solutions or partial solutions.
- Students may share class notes with anybody.
 
Selling class notes and/or other course materials to other students or
to a third party for resale is not permitted without the instructor’s
express written consent.  Violations to this and other course rules
are subject to the Code of Academic Integrity and may result in course
sanctions.  Additionally, students who use D2L or UA email to sell or
buy these copyrighted materials are subject to Code of Conduct
Violations for misuse of student email addresses. This conduct may
also constitute copyright infringement.
 
If permitted, the use of open source or third party materials in
student submissions must be clearly identified and credited.
Individual or team submissions must be substantially the work of the
student(s) who submit the work.  Copyrights, legal, and regulatory
restrictions must be respected.
