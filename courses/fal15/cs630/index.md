# Systems for Interactive Data Analysis

This is the course website for CS630, "Systems for Interactive Data
Analysis". Note: on the university infrastructure, the course title
says "Advanced Topics in Programming Languages", but that's *not* what
we'll be working on.

In this course, we will do three things: we will read research, we
will discuss research, and we will do research. A successful student
in this course will have done all three of them.

# [Syllabus](syllabus.html)

The [course syllabus](syllabus.html) is available on this website.

# Course outline

* Week 1, Introduction to course, syllabus, mechanics
  * Munzner's

  * general [academic](http://cscheid.net/advice/academics.html) [advice](http://cscheid.net/advice/students.html)
* Weeks 2-3, background
  * Classic papers, fundamental ideas. MapReduce, Dremel, data cubes,
   visualization connections
  * systems for machine learning and interactive analysis
* Week 4: students decide on research projects
* Weeks 4-n, research paper presentations, students work on research projects
* Week n-1, student project presentations

* [Data Systems for Interactive Analysis](http://www.interactive-analysis.org) 
  is a workshop which I'm helping organize, and that will happen during
  IEEE VIS 2015. The goal of the workshop is to foster research exactly
  in the area we will be discussing during the seminar.
* [IDEA, Interactive Data Exploration and Analytics](http://poloclub.gatech.edu/idea2015/index.html)
  is a similar workshop held at KDD for a few years now.
