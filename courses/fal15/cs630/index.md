# Systems for Interactive Data Analysis

This is the course website for CS630, "Systems for Interactive Data
Analysis". Note: on the university infrastructure, the course title
says "Advanced Topics in Programming Languages", but that's *not* what
we'll be working on.

* [Data Systems for Interactive Analysis](http://www.interactive-analysis.org) 
  is a workshop which I'm helping organize, and that will happen during
  IEEE VIS 2015. The goal of the workshop is to foster research exactly
  in the area we will be discussing during the seminar.
