# High Dimensional Data

In this lecture, we will learn some techniques to handle
high-dimensional data. Specifically, we will learn the basic
algorithms for *dimensionality reduction*.

The lecture will be based on
[slides](../slides/dimensionality-reduction-csc444-spr18.pdf).

### Reading Material

* Here's a longer piece on [PCA](/writing/data_science/pca.html), and another one on [MDS](/writing/data_science/mds.html).
