# Basic Spatial Arrangements

We're now done with principles and mechanics. Equipped with our
knowledge, we are ready to --- finally! ---
start building real visualizations. We will spend a week looking at
basic spatial arrangements: dot plots, scatterplots, bar charts, etc.

The lecture will be based on
[slides](../slides/spatial-arrangements-spr18-csc444.pdf).

### Reading Material

* Tamara Munzner's Visualization Analysis and Design, Chapter 7.
