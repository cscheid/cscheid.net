# Quiz: Colormap Design

Note: for every one of these questions, take into account color vision
deficiencies. It might not possible to design a colormap that
satisfies all constraints and still respects color vision
deficiencies. In that case, explain why, and present a partial
solution: a colormap where _some_ of the properties will not be easily
discernible to people with color vision deficiencies.  Explain which
properties are going to be easily visible, and which are not.

## Design

1. Design a colormap for displaying temperature on a map, such that
   relative changes in temperature are well-represented.

2. Design a colormap for displaying temperature on a map, such that
   relative changes in temperature are well-represented, and the
   problem of spatial adaptation is mitigated.

3. Design a colormap for displaying temperature on a map, such that
   relative changes in temperature are well represented, and regions
   at risk for frost are also well-represented.
   
4. Design a colormap for representing restaurant ratings when
   restaurants are plotted as dots on a map.

5. Design a colormap for displaying reasons for street arrests, when arrests
   are plotted as dots on a map.

6. Design a colormap for visualizing voting patterns on a map. The
   data available for each electoral district is:
   
   * total number of votes, 
   * percentage of democratic and republican votes
   * average per-capita income per district
   
## Implementation

Write each of the colormaps above as Javascript (pseudo-)code.
