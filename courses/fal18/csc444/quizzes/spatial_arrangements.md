# Quiz: Spatial Arrangements

1. Using the algebraic design framework presented in class, describe
   one $\alpha$s (transformations in the data) that corresponds to the
   given $\omega$s (transformation in the visual encoding) in the following scenarios:
   
   a. On a scatterplot visualization, a point moves along an axis
   encoded by a linear scale
   
   b. On a scatterplot visualization, a point moves along an axis
   encoded by a logarithmic scale

2. When visualizing a time series with a line chart, what choices are
   there besides the choice of scale in the x axis and the y axis, and
   what are the impacts of these choices?
   
3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a scatterplot
   matrix versus using a parallel coordinates plot? Use the perceptual
   principles discussed in class.
