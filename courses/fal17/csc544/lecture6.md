# Before we start

## Quiz!

Before we get started, try to solve
[drills 2, 5, 6, and 12](d3_drills/). Drill 12 is harder than the others.

## HW1 answers

Here's some of the neat answers you gave in assignment 1:

- (How do we put things in context?) I just heard that it takes about
  three years for the amount of rain which has fallen on Houston so
  far to fall on Tucson. Yikes!

- (Everyone is obsessed with ASOIAF) I am still waiting to see the
  Game of Thrones season finale, so that or maybe theories on how the
  series will end [SPOILERS REDACTED]

- (TIL about [changelog.com](https://changelog.com)) When chatting
  with CS friends I normally discuss articles I have seen on websites
  such as changelog.com or other big tech article sites
  
  - My favorite site like this is [Fermat's Library](http://fermatslibrary.com/).
  
- (TIL Java Swing is _still_ a thing) Recently I've learned about
  JavaFX, a graphics library meant to replace Java's Swing. It's
  fantastic, and takes a completely different approach to creating
  GUIs through the use of an XML like language. It acts a lot like C#
  XAML format. This has been exciting to learn and implement in my
  independent study.

- (the word "Octopodes" can be pluralized in many different ways)
  Octopuses have been known to crawl on land (and can survive on land
  for several minutes at a time).

- (AOE hype!) I recently learned about the existence of Age of Empires
  IV, which was announced 2 days ago after a decade-long hiatus. I
  grew up playing AOE I - III, and never thought I would live to see
  another sequel to the series.
