# Data Structures for fast interactive visualization

The lecture slides are [available](slides/scalability-in-visual-querying.pdf).

This is the first lecture on **techniques**. We'll start by taking a
tour of techniques for fast interaction on visualization, and then we
will switch to visualization-specific techniques.
