<!-- ## [Final Project](final_project.html) -->

<!-- In the final project for CS444/CS544, students picked a dataset of -->
<!-- their choosing (as long as it was sufficiently complex, as defined by -->
<!-- the instructing staff), and created an interactive visualization from -->
<!-- scratch. The [final project](final_project.html) page includes a list -->
<!-- of the projects as submitted by the students.   -->
