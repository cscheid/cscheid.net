# CSC 544, Advanced Data Visualization

* When: Mondays and Wednesdays, 3:30PM - 4:45PM.
* Where: GS 906

## Description of Course

In this course, you will learn how, and why, to create data
visualizations.

A "visualization" is simply a visual representation of an object of
our interest. It's *visual*: we consume them with our eyes, and so it is
essential that we know how our eyes work --- and, more importantly,
the parts of our brains connected to our eyes. It's also a
*representation*; we get to choose what this representation will be,
and different choices lead to different pictures, some good and some
bad. We will learn how to tell those apart, and how to make pictures
that are more good than bad.

Good data visualization involves perceptual psychology, mathematics,
and computer science. This makes our subject uniquely challenging:
sometimes the way our eyes work stands in way of applying some
beautiful result from computer science. Sometimes it's the other way
around: something deep about the math in the data will help guide the
design process and let us make a picture that is beautiful,
informative, and truthful.

The content of the course is split roughly in three distinct aspects:
mechanics, principles, and techniques.

Although there are no specific prerequisites to this regard, we will
write most of our code using the web stack. This means we are
targeting modern web browsers, and writing our programs in a
combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you don't know these
technologies, you will be expected to learn them.

## Absence and Class Participation Policy

The UA's policy concerning Class Attendance, Participation, and Administrative Drops is available [here](http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/class-attendance-participation-and-administrative-drop).
The [UA policy regarding absences for any sincerely held religious belief, observance or practice](http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/religious-accommodation-policy) will be accommodated where reasonable.
Absences pre approved by the UA Dean of Students (or dean’s designee)
will be honored. See
[the dean of students's website](https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/absences)
for details.

## Makeup Policy for Students Who Register Late

If you register late for this class, contact me as soon as you do. You
will be expected to submit all missed assignments within a week of
your registration. It is your responsibility to catch up to the class
content.

## Course Communications

We will use [Piazza](https://piazza.com/arizona/fall2017/csc544/home)
for communications and discussion.

## Required Texts or Readings

There is no required textbook for the course, and all of the necessary
material will be available in slides and lecture notes, but Tamara
Munzner's book is really good reading if you're interested in
visualization. 

* Tamara Munzner,
  [Visualization Analysis and Design](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/courses/533-11/book/).
  
I have a copy I intend to keep in my office at all times, in case you
want to browse it before deciding to buy it. Other excellent books I
recommend include (again, ask me to take a look at them if you're
curious):

* William Cleveland, The Elements of Graphing Data
* William Cleveland, Visualizing Data
* John W. Tukey, Exploratory Data Analysis
* Edward Tufte, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information

If you want to dive deeper into visualization, you should have read,
at least once, the following books:

* Jacques Bertin, Semiology of Graphics
* Edward Tufte, Visual Explanations
* Edward Tufte, Envisioning Information
* Colin Ware, Information Visualization

We will also be reading content from some web pages and some research
papers. When you're expected to read material ahead of time, the
material will be posted on the course web page at least one week in
advance, and will be discussed in class.

## Assignments and Examinations: Schedule/Due Dates

## Final Examination or Project

There will be one individual comprehensive final project.

For the final project, you will do either of the following:

- build one larger visualization of your own choosing, using the
  mechanics, principles and techniques you learn in this course, and
  will be graded to the extent in which your visualization respects
  these. Each student can expect to spend about as much time on the
  final project as they will on all assignments, combined.

- work on a research-oriented project of your own choosing, as long as
it:

  1) involves visualization

  2) is a concrete and significant step towards a research paper,
  either about using data visualization in your area of research, or a
  visualization research paper itself.

A successful final project does not have to be a finished paper, but
the clearer it is how to take what you have and turn it into a
reasonable submission to a workshop, conference, or journal, the
better.

## Grading Scale and Policies

I will grade your assignments, midterms, and final project on a scale
from 0 to 100, with respective weights of 50%, 20% and 30%. 
In addition, I will give class participation 5% weight. This will
give you a score from 0 to 105. Your final grade in the course of be
the *best* of a per-class grading curve and overall performance:

Overall performance: 

* 90% or better: A;
* 75% or better: B;
* 60% or better: C;
* 40% or better: D;
* below 40%: F.

Grades for assignments, midterm and final project will be posted on
D2L as soon as we have them. Grades for assignments will be posted no
more than 2 weeks after each the deadline for each assignment.

**Requests for incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W)** must be made in
accordance with University policies, which are available at
<http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#incomplete>
and
<http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#Withdrawal>,
respectively.

### Dispute of Grade Policy

If you wish to dispute your grade for an assignment, midterm or
project, you have two weeks after the grade has been turned in. In
addition, even if only you dispute one portion of the grading for that
unit, I reserve the right to revisit the entire unit (assignment,
midterm, or project).

## Department of Computer Science Code of Conduct

The Department of Computer Science is committed to providing and
maintaining a supportive educational environment for all.  We strive
to be welcoming and inclusive, respect privacy and confidentiality,
behave respectfully and courteously, and practice intellectual
honesty.  Disruptive behaviors (such as physical or emotional
harassment, dismissive attitudes, and abuse of department resources)
will not be tolerated.  The complete Code of Conduct is available on
our department web site.  We expect that you will adhere to this code,
as well as the UA Student Code of Conduct, while you are a member of
this class.

## Classroom Behavior Policy

To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors
have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive
environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where
we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on
the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting,
chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.).

Inclusive Excellence is a fundamental part of the University of
Arizona’s strategic plan and culture. As part of this initiative, the
institution embraces and practices diversity and inclusiveness.  These
values are expected, respected and welcomed in this course.

Students are asked to refrain from disruptive conversations with
people sitting around them during lecture. Students observed engaging
in disruptive activity will be asked to cease this behavior. Those who
continue to disrupt the class will be asked to leave lecture or
discussion and may be reported to the Dean of Students. 

Alternate language for those who want to restrict computers and
laptops to an area of the classroom: Some learning styles are best
served by using personal electronics, such as laptops and iPads. These
devices can be distracting to other learners. Therefore, students who
prefer to use electronic devices for note-taking during lecture should
use one side of the classroom.

## Threatening Behavior Policy 

The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of
physical harm to any member of the University community, including to
oneself. See
<http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students>. 

## Notification of Objectionable Materials

This course will, at times, contain material of a mature nature, which
may include references to historical violence as collected and
depicted in datasets and data visualizations. The instructor will
provide advance notice when such materials will be used.  Students are
not automatically excused from interacting with such materials, but
they are encouraged to speak with the instructor to voice concerns and
to provide feedback.

## Elective Name and Pronoun Usage

It is already UA policy that class rosters are provided to instructors
with a student’s preferred name. Students may share their preferred
name and pronoun with members of the teaching staff and fellow
students, as desired, and these gender identities and gender
expressions will be honored in this course. As the course includes
group work and in-class discussion, it is critical to create an
educational environment of inclusion and mutual respect. In this
class, to be inclusive of all gender identities and expressions,
students will be referred to by their first or last names, the pronoun
of their choice, or by default, the pronoun "they".

## Accessibility and Accommodations

Our goal in this classroom is that learning experiences be as
accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience physical or
academic barriers based on disability, please let me know immediately
so that we can discuss options. You are also welcome to contact the
Disability Resource Center (520-621-3268) to establish reasonable
accommodations. For additional information on the Disability Resource
Center and reasonable accommodations, please visit
<http://drc.arizona.edu>.

If you have reasonable accommodations, please plan to meet with me by
appointment or during office hours to discuss accommodations and how
my course requirements and activities may impact your ability to fully
participate.

Please be aware that the accessible table and chairs in this room
should remain available for students who find that standard classroom
seating is not usable.


## Code of Academic Integrity

Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely
the principles and applications of course materials. However, graded
work/exercises must be the product of independent effort unless
otherwise instructed. Students are expected to adhere to the UA Code
of Academic Integrity as described in the UA General Catalog. See
<http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/academic-integrity/students/academic-integrity>.

The University Libraries have
some excellent tips for avoiding plagiarism, available at
<http://www.library.arizona.edu/help/tutorials/plagiarism/index.html>.


## UA Nondiscrimination and Anti-harassment Policy 

The University is committed to creating and maintaining an environment
free of discrimination; see
<http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy>.

Our classroom is a place where everyone is encouraged to express
well-formed opinions and their reasons for those opinions. We also
want to create a tolerant and open environment where such opinions can
be expressed without resorting to bullying or discrimination of
others.
