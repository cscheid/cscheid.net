# Other visual channels

## Slides

The lecture slides
[are available here](slides/other-visual-channels-csc544-fal17.pdf).

## Extras

- [Mixing shape and color to explore preattentive processing](https://cscheid.net/courses/spr15/cs444/lectures/week8/preattentive.html).

## Reading

- [Gestalt principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping). Honestly,
  some of this stuff is useful. But a lot of it is borderline mystical
  woowoo on which we don't actually have a good scientific handle on,
  and so we'll mostly skip it. I'm including it so you know the term
  when you hear other people use it.
  
- [Bubble sets: Revealing set relations with isocontours over existing visualizations](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5802/9798a1abd90a2338d109b1a6678cf7923813.pdf).
