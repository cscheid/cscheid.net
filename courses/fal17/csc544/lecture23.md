# Topics in undirected graphs

We're going to cover content mostly from papers:

* [Graph Drawing by Force-directed Placement](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=19A8857540E8C9C26397650BBACD5311?doi=10.1.1.13.8444&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Software -- Practice and Experience, 1991. [Efficient and High-Quality Force-Directed Graph Drawing](http://yifanhu.net/PUB/graph_draw_small.pdf), Mathematica Journal. Specifically, we'll use it as an introduction to Barnes-Hut for quadratically-decaying forces.
* [Classical Multidimensional Scaling](https://cscheid.net/writing/data_science/mds.html). How to match distances directly in our embeddings.
* [Graph Drawing by Stress Majorization](http://www.graphviz.org/Documentation/GKN04.pdf), Graph Drawing 2014. CMDS "matches square distances". How to drop the square term (and more)
* [Two key properties of dimensionality reduction methods](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008663), CIDM 2014. Distance concentration makes direct distance matching impossible.
* [Visualizing Data using t-SNE](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/publications/papers/JMLR_2008.pdf), JMLR 2008. [Graph Drawing by t-SNE](http://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~kobourov/tsne-eurovis17.pdf), EuroVis 2017
