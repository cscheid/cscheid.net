## Design

1. Design a colormap for displaying temperature on a map, such that
   relative changes in temperature are well-represented.

2. Design a colormap for displaying temperature on a map, such that
   relative changes in temperature are well-represented, and the
   problem of spatial adaptation is mitigated.

3. Design a colormap for displaying temperature on a map, such that
   relative changes in temperature are well represented, and regions
   at risk for frost are also well-represented.
   
4. Design a colormap for representing restaurant ratings when
   restaurants are plotted as dots on a map.

5. Design a colormap for displaying reasons for street arrests, when arrests
   are plotted as dots on a map.
