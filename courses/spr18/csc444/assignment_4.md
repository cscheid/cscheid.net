# Assignment 4

- Posting date: Feb. 1st
- Due date: Feb. 8th 11:59PM MST
- GitHub classroom: [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/OnefO4pE)


# Description

In this assignment, you will recreate some of the previous
visualizations we've seen in class using d3. Specifically, you will recreate
the examples in the [last iteration](lectures/lecture4/iteration_8.html) of the
code we developed in Lecture 3, and you will also recreate the first
visualization of Assignment 3.

You will turn in an HTML file named `index.html`. Each visualization
should be an SVG element of the same dimensions used previously. The
`id` attributes of the elements shouls also match the ones we used
previously. They should be, respectively, `chart1`,
`chart2`, `chart3`, and `scatterplot_1`.

Your visualizations have to be created using d3 calls. In other words,
the way to turn data into SVG elements has to be through d3 methods
like `selectAll`, `data`, `enter` and `append`.

For this assignment, you are allowed to use any additional library you'd
like. You are required to use [d3](http://d3js.org), but maybe you'll
also want to use
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/),
[underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/), or whatever else you like. Remember
to give proper attribution in your writeup and source code.

## Assessment

Each of the plots is worth 25% of the total credit.
