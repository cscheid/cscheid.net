# Assignment 1

- Posting date: Jan 11th 2018
- Due date: Jan 18th 2018, 11:59PM MST.
- Github classroom link: [Assignment 1](https://classroom.github.com/a/YZ5SrSXc).

# Description

Your first assignment is to fill out this questionnaire and submit it
via GitHub classroom. This is mostly so that I have a chance to learn somthing
about you, but it's also to ensure you know how GitHub and GitHub
classroom works, and to ensure that I can see
your submissions.

You will submit a single plain-text file called `answers.txt`. 
This file should contain the answers to the questions below, formatted
like below:

    CSC444 Data Visualization
	Assignment 1
	YOUR_NAME_HERE

    1. I want to take this course because I want to learn about
	d3; I hear it will land me a great job.
	
    2. Java, Javascript, C#, PHP.
	
	3. Java.
	
	4. no answer.

    etc.

You are not required to answer any of the questions if you don't want
to, but non-submission does not count: please write "no answer" if
that's the case. 

I am going to use the answers to calibrate the remainder of the
course, so this is an opportunity for you to influence where the
course goes. There are no right or wrong answers in this
questionnaire. All I ask is you answer honestly, without trying to
figure out what I might want to read. The more you write, the more
I'll know about your expectations and what you are interested in.

## Submission Instructions

*Do not check in a zip file*. Your repository should consist of a
 single file, named `answers.txt`.

*Do not use subdirectories*. The `answers.txt` file should be in the
root directory of your git repository. So if you're working on
your assignment in a folder (say, "assignment3").

We're not going to deduct any points for these right now, but having
to handle these different cases separately makes Ashwin and Alex's jobs much
harder - we reserve the right to deduct points from repeat offenders.

# Questionnaire: tell me about you

1. Why are you taking this course?

2. What do you think you'll learn in this course?

3. What programming languages are you comfortable with?

4. Have you used git before? If so, for how long?

5. Have you used GitHub before? If so, for how long?

6. Which programming language are you *most comfortable* with?

7. Have you ever created a data visualization? What was it?

8. During the course of your studies, what's the largest dataset
you've had to deal with? What tools did you use?

9. What's the best visualization you've ever seen? Why do you like it?

10. What's the worst visualization you've ever seen? Why do you not like it?

11. Tell me about something cool you learned recently. (The kind of
thing I'm looking for is: If you were meeting with a friend, what
would you chat about?) Possible answers: good books -- fiction or not
-- films, TV shows, blogs, podcasts, etc. It does not have to be about
data visualization.
