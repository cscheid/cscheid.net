# Lectures 7 and 8: Color Vision

We will now start to learn about **principles** to guide data
visualization design. Today, we will learn about the basics of color
vision, and in the next lecture, we will learn how to use some of this
knowledge to design good visualizations.

Today's lecture will be based on slides:
[1](../slides/color-spr18-csc444.pdf), and
[2](../slides/color-2-spr18-csc444.pdf).

you remember d3 basics.
