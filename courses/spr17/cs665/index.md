# Computational Data Science

(The course is listed as "Advanced Topics in Computational
Intelligence", but it'll be run as a much more general course).

* Instructor: [Carlos Scheidegger](http://cscheid.net)
* Lectures: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 3:30PM - 4:45PM, Bio Sciences West 212
* Office Hours: Mondays 1-2PM, Tuesdays 2:30PM-3:30PM (please email
  ahead of time for the Tuesday slot).

In this course, we will study the theory and practice of **data
science** from a computational perspective.

On the theoretical side, we will study the how computer science lets
us uniquely combine geometry and algorithms to make sense of data sets
both small and large.

On the practical side, we will study the consequences of using
automated, data-driven decision making.

The primary textbook for the course will be
[Foundations of Data Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/book.pdf),
by Blum, Hopcroft and Kannan.
