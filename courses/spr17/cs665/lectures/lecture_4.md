# Jan 24, Lecture 4

Reading: FODS, Chapter 6, in addition to papers listed below. 

We will continue (and finish) our discussion of CM Sketches, and
specifically how to build CM sketches for the computation of
approximate quantiles.

## Techniques

* [CM Sketches](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~graham/pubs/papers/cm-full.pdf)
  * We will look at how to use CM sketches to estimate quantiles under
    the turnstile model.  This uses a technique from a different
    paper:
    [How to summarize the world](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~muthu/543Kotidis.pdf)
