# Assignment 4

- Due date for first proposal: Mar 28th, 11:59PM local time

# Project Proposal

The final project of this course is either an implementation of a
recently-published research result from the literature, or a
substantial first step towards a research publication. Your assignment
4 will be a one-page project proposal, and this assignment will span
two pieces.

# First part, due Mar 28th

The first part of the project proposal will involve you writing a
one-page description (in total) of:

* **What you are going to implement.** This means you need to find a paper
  in the literature that is interesting to you, and sufficiently
  challenging.
* **How it relates to your work.** I want this project to relate to
  your intended field of research or work. You need to articulate
  that in your proposal.
* **How will you know that you succeeded?** You need to outline
  expectations for the state of the project by the time you present
  the final report.
* **How will you know that the technique is good?** You will need to
  run an independent evaluation of the work. How do you intend to
  compare the technique with the other work that has existed in the
  area?
	
If you submit this project proposal late, then you forfeit the grade
of this entire assignment, **but you still need to submit a final project
proposal to get a grade for your final project**.

# Second part, due Apr 11th

I will, in a week's time, give you feedback on your submission. If my
feedback is "no changes required, go ahead", then you don't need to
change your proposal. However, my feedback might include requested
changes to any of the four points. In that case, you will need to
address those changes by the 11th of April and resubmit it to me.

I will grade your assignment on the state of your proposal, on a scale
of 0 to 100. If you get feedback to the effect of "no changes
required", then you get 100 on the assignment. If not, then to the
extent that I think you addressed appropriately each of the four
points above, you will be graded 25 points.
