# Lectures 7 and 8: Color Vision

We will now start to learn about **principles** to guide data
visualization design. Today, we will learn about the basics of color
vision, and in the next lecture, we will learn how to use some of this
knowledge to design good visualizations.

The next two lectures will be based on slides:
[1](../slides/color-fall-2019-csc444.pdf), and
[2](../slides/color-2-fall-2019-csc444.pdf).

## Quiz

We'll also go over some [D3 drills](/projects/d3-drills/) to make sure
you remember d3 basics.
