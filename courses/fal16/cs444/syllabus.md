# CSC 444: Data Visualization

* Location: GS 906
* Times: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9:30AM-10:45AM
* Discussion: [Piazza](http://piazza.com/arizona/fall2016/cs444/).

## Description of Course

Welcome to CS444, Data Visualization. In this course, you will learn
how, and why, to create data visualizations.  Please read this
syllabus carefully, and contact the instructor should you have any
questions about its content.

A "visualization" is simply a visual representation of an object of
our interest. It's *visual*: we consume them with our eyes, and so it
is essential that we know how our eyes work --- and, more importantly,
the parts of our brains connected to our eyes. It's also a
*representation*; we get to choose what this representation will be,
and different choices lead to different pictures, some good and some
bad. We will learn how to tell those apart, and how to make pictures
that are more good than bad.

Good data visualization involves perceptual
psychology, mathematics, and computer science. This makes our subject
uniquely challenging: sometimes the way our eyes work stands in
way of applying some beautiful result from computer science. Sometimes
it's the other way around: something deep about the math in the data
will help guide the design process and let us make a picture that is beautiful,
informative, and truthful.

The content of the course is split roughly in three distinct aspects:
mechanics, principles, and techniques.

## Course Format and Teaching Methods (recommended, not required)

* Lectures and in-class discussions

## Course Objectives and Expected Learning Outcomes

First of all, you will learn why and how to build data visualizations
in order to understand complex data sets. This will involve a mix of
computer science, mathematics, and perceptual psychology. You will
understand why certain visualizations work well, why some of them are
easier to build than others, and the limits of what we can currently
do with our computers and eyes.

You will learn this by a combination of presentation of lecture
material, programming assignments and in-class discussions.

You will be assessed based on your performance on the programming
assignments, one midterm exam and one final exam, and in-class
participation.

## Absence and Class Participation Policy

The UA’s policy concerning Class Attendance, Participation, and Administrative Drops is available at [this page](http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/class-attendance-participation-and-administrative-drop).

The UA policy regarding absences for any sincerely held religious belief, observance or practice will be accommodated where reasonable: see [this page](http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/religious-accommodation-policy).

Absences preapproved by the UA Dean of Students (or dean’s designee) will be honored. See [this page](https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/absences).

Participating in the course and attending lectures and other course
events are vital to the learning process. As such, attendance is
required at all lectures and discussion section meetings. Students who
miss class due to illness or emergency are required to bring
documentation from their health-care provider or other relevant,
professional third parties. Failure to submit third-party
documentation will result in unexcused absences.

## Makeup Policy for Students Who Register Late

A central part of this course is a large number of small programming assignments. If you register after the first class meeting, you will be allowed to make up missed assignments, but those will *all* be due at the day that the next assignment is due. You are responsible for notifying me about a late registration so we can make grading accommodations.

## Course Communications

Online communication will be made on [piazza](http://piazza.com/arizona/fall2016/cs444/). For urgent communications with the instructors, send email to [fall16cs444@cs.arizona.edu](mailto:fall16cs444@cs.arizona.edu)

## Required Texts or Readings

There is no required textbook. All material will be available online, including lecture slides.

There are many good visualization textbooks, all optional:

* Tamara Munzner, [Visualization Analysis and Design](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/).
* Scott Murray, [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web]().

## Assessment

As mentioned above, you will be assessed based on your performance on
programming assignments, one midterm exam and one final exam, and
in-class participation.

I will grade your assignments, midterms, and final exam on a scale
from 0 to 100, with respective weights of 50%, 20% and 30%. 
In addition, I will give class participation 5% weight. This will
give you a score from 0 to 105. Your final grade in the course of be
the *best* of a per-class grading curve and overall performance:

Overall performance: 

* 90% or better: A;
* 80% or better: B;
* 70% or better: C;
* 60% or better: D;
* below 60%: F.

By October 30th (your last day to withdraw), you will know more than 40%
of your grade by weight.

The class participation grading is *discretionary*. I will give you
feedback on class participation on request.

Grades for assignments, midterm and final project will be posted on
D2L as soon as we have them. The grading for each assignment will be
provided one week after the assignment is due.

### Midterm and final

* Midterm date: Tuesday, October 25th, 2016.
  * Exam grades will be returned by October 30th.
* Final date: Dec 13th 2016, 8:00AM-10:00AM.
  * Location: TBD.

Please refer to the [UA Final exam regulations](https://www.registrar.arizona.edu/courses/final-examination-regulations-and-information) for more information.

### Programming assignments

There will be a total of eleven programming assignments, each due a
week after they are posted, 11:59PM of that day. Tentative dates for assignments:

| Assignment | Post | Due (@11:59PM) | Grades returned (@9:30AM) |
|------------|-----------|----------|-----------------------|
| [1](assignment_1.html) | Aug 23 | Aug 30 | Sep 6  |
| [2](assignment_2.html) | Aug 30 | Sep 6  | Sep 13 |
| [3](assignment_3.html) | Sep 6  | Sep 13 | Sep 20 |
| [4](assignment_4.html) | Sep 13 | Sep 20 | Sep 27 |
| [5](assignment_5.html) | Sep 20 | Sep 27 | Oct 4  |
| [6](assignment_6.html) | Sep 27 | Oct 4  | Oct 11 |
| [7](assignment_7.html) | Oct 4  | Oct 11 | Oct 18 |
| [8](assignment_8.html) | Oct 11 | Nov 1  | Nov 8  |
| [9](assignment_9.html) | Nov 1  | Nov 8  | Nov 15 |
| [10](assignment_10.html) | Nov 8 | Nov 15 | Nov 22 |
| [11](assignment_11.html) | Nov 15 | Nov 22 | Nov 29 |

These assignments will test whether you understood the concepts
discussed in the previous week, and will be small and
self-contained. You'll submit a webpage, typically, with a
demonstration of the concept we discussed and a short explanation
(around a paragraph or two).

The assignments will be given equal weights (towards the 50% total
weight of assignments, as posted above).

Assignments will be posted on tuesdays, and will be due on the
following tuesday at the time class starts. My office hours are
tuesday, 1:00-3:00PM. 

Late assignments will *not* be allowed outside of extenuating
circumstances.  Students who miss assignments due to illness or
emergency and want to submit them later are required to bring
documentation from their health-care provider or other relevant,
professional third parties. Failure to submit third-party
documentation will result in a zero grade for those assignments.

### Policies

Requests for incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) must be made in accordance with University policies, which are available [here](http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system), (under "incomplete" and "withdrawal", respectively).

### Dispute of Grade Policy

If you wish to dispute a grade on an assignment, midterm, or final,
you have two weeks after the grades have been posted.

# Conduct

## Department of Computer Science Code of Conduct

The Department of Computer Science is committed to providing and
maintaining a supportive educational environment for all.  We strive
to be welcoming and inclusive, respect privacy and confidentiality,
behave respectfully and courteously, and practice intellectual
honesty.  Disruptive behaviors (such as physical or emotional
harassment, dismissive attitudes, and abuse of department resources)
will not be tolerated.  The complete Code of Conduct is available on
our department web site.  We expect that you will adhere to this code,
as well as the UA Student Code of Conduct, while you are a member of
this class.

## Classroom Behavior Policy

To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.).

Students are asked to refrain from disruptive conversations with people sitting around them during lecture. Students observed engaging in disruptive activity will be asked to cease this behavior. Those who continue to disrupt the class will be asked to leave lecture or discussion and may be reported to the Dean of Students. 

Some learning styles are best served by using personal electronics, such as laptops and iPads. These devices can be distracting to other learners. Therefore, students who prefer to use electronic devices for note-taking during lecture should use one side of the classroom. 

## Threatening Behavior Policy 

The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of physical harm to any member of the University community, including to oneself. See http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students. 

## Code of Academic Integrity

Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely the principles and applications of course materials. However, graded work/exercises must be the product of independent effort unless otherwise instructed. Students are expected to adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity as described in the UA General Catalog. See http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/academic-integrity/students/academic-integrity.
Recommended language, if applicable: The University Libraries have some excellent tips for avoiding plagiarism, available at http://www.library.arizona.edu/help/tutorials/plagiarism/index.html.
Recommended language, if applicable: Selling class notes and/or other course materials to other students or to a third party for resale is not permitted without the instructor’s express written consent. Violations to this and other course rules are subject to the Code of Academic Integrity and may result in course sanctions. Additionally, students who use D2L or UA e-mail to sell or buy these copyrighted materials are subject to Code of Conduct Violations for misuse of student e-mail addresses. This conduct may also constitute copyright infringement.

## UA Nondiscrimination and Anti-harassment Policy 

The University is committed to creating and maintaining an environment free of discrimination; see http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy
Recommended language, if applicable: Our classroom is a place where everyone is encouraged to express well-formed opinions and their reasons for those opinions. We also want to create a tolerant and open environment where such opinions can be expressed without resorting to bullying or discrimination of others.
