Welcome to CS444, Data Visualization. In this course, you will learn
how, and why, to create data visualizations.  Please read
[the syllabus](syllabus.html) carefully, and contact the instructor
should you have any questions about its content.

A "visualization" is simply a visual representation of an object of
our interest. It's *visual*: we consume them with our eyes, and so it
is essential that we know how our eyes work --- and, more importantly,
the parts of our brains connected to our eyes. It's also a
*representation*; we get to choose what this representation will be,
and different choices lead to different pictures, some good and some
bad. We will learn how to tell those apart, and how to make pictures
that are more good than bad.

Good data visualization involves perceptual
psychology, mathematics, and computer science. This makes our subject
uniquely challenging: sometimes the way our eyes work stands in
way of applying some beautiful result from computer science. Sometimes
it's the other way around: something deep about the math in the data
will help guide the design process and let us make a picture that is beautiful,
informative, and truthful.

The content of the course is split roughly in three distinct aspects:
mechanics, principles, and techniques.
