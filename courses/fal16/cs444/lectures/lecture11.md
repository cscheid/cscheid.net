# Lecture 11: Interaction, Filtering, Aggregation

The lecture will be based on
[slides](../slides/interaction.pdf) as well. 

## Context

We've now seen all perceptual principles that will be covered in
class. Today, we will talk about **interaction**: often, datasets are
too large or complicated to be visualized all at once. In that case,
we will write interactive visualizations: programs that respond to
user actions, and these actions let users select smaller regions of
the data, or show different aspects.

We will cover how to do event handling in javascript and d3, and then
learn what are the most common ways to provide interaction in
visualizations: filtering and aggregation.

### Reading Material

* [d3 event handlers](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#handling-events)
* [Smooth and Efficient Zooming and Panning](https://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/zoompan.pdf).
