# Lecture 15: Linear Algebra Review

* [Slides](../slides/Dimensionality%20Reduction.pdf) for this week's lectures

## Vectors

## Inner products

## Angles

## Lengths

## Bases, Linear Transformations

## Eigenvectors

[Here](lecture15/eigenvectors.html) is an interactive demo where you
can explore the relationship between the values of a symmetric 2x2
matrix and its eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
