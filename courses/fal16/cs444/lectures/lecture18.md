# Lecture 18: Hierarchies

In this lecture and the next, we are going to start covering
visualization techniques for **relationship data**. Up until now, we
looked at a dataset as a collection of values that are mostly
independent of each other (students in a college class, different
flower samples, etc). The main novelty now is that we are interested
in the relationships between elements in the data. We start by
covering hierarchies, and then we will look at more general graphs.

Slides for today's are [here](../slides/Hierarchies.pdf).
