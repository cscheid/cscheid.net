# Lecture 10: Other Perceptual Channels, Gestalt

The lecture will be based on
[slides](../slides/Other%20Channels%202.pdf) as well. 

Today we are going to end the discussion on perceptual channels, and
talk about Gestalt principles.

### Reading Material

Today's lecture includes a larger number of references to recent
academic work. This is all optional reading material (they will not
be on the midterm or final). But if you are interested in learning
data visualization more deeply, you are strongly encouraged to read
these carefully.
