# Lecture 3, JavaScript

Today, we learn the basics of JavaScript, and start by making simple
programs that animate simple things with it. By the end of the next lecture
(and a good amount of experimenting of your own), you will have most of
the tools you need to write visualizations in JavaScript. Later in the
course, we'll use d3 because of its power and expressivity. But all
that d3 does is use these APIs for you, and it is important that you
understand at some level how d3 works.

## Resources and reading

There are many good resources for learning JavaScript on the
web. 

As I did last week, I highly recommend Scott Murray's
"Interactive Data Visualization for the Web", and specifically
[its chapter 3](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch03.html).
And, again as I did last week, I'll say you should
[just buy it if you can](http://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_14?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=interactive+data+visualization+for+the+web&sprefix=interactive+da%2Caps%2C398).

Douglas Crockford's
[JavaScript, the Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742#)
is at the time of writing also only 20 dollars, and it's a handy
reference. David Herman's
[Effective JavaScript](http://www.amazon.com/Effective-JavaScript-Specific-Software-Development/dp/0321812182)
is a bit more expensive, but also deeper.

In addition, you can also read the
[Mozilla Developer Network's JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide). It
will cover much of what this covers. For a slower, more interactive
take on the same material, there's
[codecademy's JavaScript track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript).
Every time I search for javascript documentation on google, I just
throw in the term `mdn`, for Mozilla Developer Network. This makes
sure that MDN is in the first few hits, and the quality of the results
is much improved.

If you're following the text below, my suggestion is that you either
open the Developer Tools's JavaScript console on a browser window, and
type the examples to see what they do, like we go over in class. You
should also try variants, and just generally play around with the
console, to get a feel for the language.

Before we get started, though, a few words of warning: there is *a
lot* of bad JavaScript advice on the internet. For example, although
StackOverflow is typically a high-quality Q&A website, I would stay
well away from it when it comes to JavaScript (why that is the case is
beyond my understanding). Finally, the introduction below is not meant to
give you a comprehensive description of JavaScript, but rather a
*foothold*. 

Once you become proficient in the language, then you can start
worrying about best practices and special cases, especially as they
related to performance and portability across browsers. It's easier
for you simply not to worry about that kind of stuff right now. This
does mean that if you're a veteran JavaScript programmer, you'll spot
places where what I'm writing is not 100% accurate.  If you were to
complain, you'd be technically correct, but what are you doing reading
a JavaScript beginner's guide? We're in Tucson; it's sunny outside!

# JavaScript, the very basics

If you know any other mainstream programming language, JavaScript will
feel sufficiently familiar. It has *variables* which hold *values*:

    a = 0;
	b = "1";
	c = [1, 2, "3", [4]];
	f = false;
	f = 34.56;

The first thing to notice is that JavaScript's variables are
*dynamically typed*: you don't need to declare their types before
using them, and they can refer to values of different types at
different times in the program execution. (This is convenient but
quite error-prone: it's usually a bad idea to make too much use of
this feature.)

You also do not need to declare a variable ahead of time. If you
don't, then JavaScript either assumes you're referring to an already
existing variable, *or it creates a new global variable*. Again, this
is convenient but very error-prone (this is a theme, as you'll
see). One common source of confusion is that typos in variable
assignments are not caught: they just become global variables.

To create a *local* variable, use the keyword `var`:

    var x = 0;

To print a value on the console, use `console.log`:

    console.log(a);
	console.log(22 / 7);
	console.log(Math.PI);

Compound values in JavaScript will be of either of two types: *arrays*
or *objects*. Array literals are declared using square brackets:

    var c = [0,1,2];
	var e = []; // empty array declaration

Arrays are addressed using square brackets, like many other languages:

    console.log(c[0]);

(Notice that array values can have different types as well.) The other
main type of compound value in JavaScript is the *object*. Objects are
declared with curly brackets:

    obj = {
        key1: 3,
        key2: 4
    };

Array values be accessed with curly brackets, and so can object
values:

    console.log(obj["key1"]);

Notice how we're using strings here as keys. Alternatively, you can
use a familiar notation from other object-oriented languages:

    console.log(obj.key1);

You can also add new fields to objects.

    obj.key3 = "new value";

But, as usual, this can be error-prone:

    obj.Key3 = "something"; // this is likely not what you meant!

These are the basics to get you started reading JavaScript code. We'll
say more about these values as needed.

## Making more complicated programs

Programs that are just sequences of variable assignments are not very
exciting, and one way we usually build more complex programs is via
*procedural abstraction*. We define a sequence of steps we'd like to
give a special name, and create a procedure that performs those steps
for us. In JavaScript we use the keyword `function` for this:

    function someFunction(v) {
        if (v < 10) {
            return v;
        } else {
            return v*v;
        }
    }

This produces the expected results:

    console.log(someFunction(30));
	console.log(someFunction(-5));

But, as usual, JavaScript lets you do strange things that are
convenient sometimes, and confusing at other times:

    console.log(someFunction("50"));
    console.log(someFunction("what?"));
    console.log(someFunction(30, "huh?"));
    console.log(someFunction(30, "huh?"));
    console.log(someFunction()); 

None of the calls above cause runtime errors. If you call a function
with too many parameters, JavaScript will simply ignore the extra
ones. If you call a function with *too few* parameters, JavaScript
gives the local parameters the special value `undefined`. Local
scopes (where local variables can be defined) can only be created
inside functions:

    function anotherFunction(v2) {
        var x = v2 * 10;
        return x * v2;
    }
    
    console.log(x); 
	// If your global scope has no x variable, this will raise
	// an error.

The typical way to declare a function to be called by a name is what
we just saw. But there's another important way to achieve the same
effect:

    someOtherFunction = function(v) {
        if (v > 10) {
            return "big";
        } else {
            return "small";
        }
    };

Pay attention to what's happening here: this is assigning a value to a
variable, in the same way that `x = "hi"` assigns the string value
`"hi"` to the variable `x`. But that value is a function! This is
important. In JavaScript, functions are values that can be stored in
variables. When a variable is holding a function, you call that
function by using the parenthesis notation, as you'd expect:

    someOtherFunction(30);

But later you can reassign that function, and then you'd be calling
something else:

	someOtherFunction = function(x) { return x - 5; };
	someOtherFunction(30); // returns 25 instead of "big";

This is your first exposure to the idea that JavaScript is a
"functional" language. In the same way that you can store function
values in variables, you can pass them around as parameters, store
them in arrays, object fields, and even use them as return values of
other functions! This is a powerful idea that we will use a lot.

JavaScript has `for` loops, like C:

    for (i=0; i<10; ++i) {
        console.log(i);
    }

While loops:

    i = 3;
    while (i<100) {
        console.log(i);
        i = i * 2;
    }

Do loops:

	i = 3;
	do {
		console.log(i);
		i = i * 2;
	} while (i<100);

and switch statements:

    i = "some case";
    switch (i) {
    case "string literals ok":
        console.log("Yes");
        break;
    case "some case":
        console.log("Unlike C");
        break;
    }

Notice that the switch statement accepts string literals, unlike what
you might be used to from C.

## Making more complicated programs

If we create an object with slots that hold functions, this starts to
look like methods from Java and Python. If we create a function that
returns these objects, this starts to look like class contructors:

    // Let's build something that looks like OOP
    function createObject(content) {
        var result = {
            get: function() {
                return content;
            },
            set: function(newValue) {
                content = newValue;
            },
            twice: function() {
                return content * 2;
            }
        };
        return result;
    }

    f = createObject("something");
    f.get();
    f.twice();
    f.set(20);
    f.get();
    f.twice();

It's interesting to note how, with no class declarations, JavaScript
provides something that has a strong "object-oriented" feel (in
constrast to C++, Java, and Python). In fact, using just this pattern
above, you can write a lot of object-oriented software. The only thing
you're missing is inheritance.

## Inheritance, without classes

JavaScript *does* support a notion of inheritance, but it does it
without any classes. This means that there's no subclasses, so how
does it work?

Instead of subclasses, JavaScript has the notion of a *prototype
chain*. Every JavaScript object has a special field which points to
another object. Then, every time you tell JavaScript to access a
field from an object, it tries to find the field. If the field exists,
then the lookup is performed. If, however, the field doesn't exist,
then JavaScript checks for the presence of a special *prototype* field
in the object. If that field is not `null`, then the JavaScript
runtime performs a recursive access of the field in the prototype
object. This is more obvious with an example. Make sure to run these in
your JavaScript console:

    // Inheritance, with no classes
    base = {
        v1: 1,
        v2: 2
    };
    
    derived = {
        v1: 5,
        v3: 3,
        v4: 4
    };
    
    console.log(base.v1);
    console.log(derived.v1);
    console.log(derived.v2);
	
	// this calls sets the prototype of derived to be the base
    Object.setPrototypeOf(derived, base);
    console.log(derived.v1);
    console.log(derived.v2);

This way, when you want to create a subclassing relationship, you do
it by defining a *base* object, and making sure that derived objects
have the base object as their prototypes. In practice, you would never
call `setPrototypeOf` directly. Instead, you'd call `Object.create`,
which creates a fresh new object without any fields (like `{}`), but
with a set prototype:

    // Instead of using setPrototypeOf, use:
    v = Object.create(null); // this is just the same as {}
    v2 = Object.create(base);
    v3 = Object.create(v2); // etc.

## The special variable `this`

JavaScript has a special variable that is available at every scope
called `this`. When a function is called with a notation that
resembles methods in typical object-oriented languages, say
`obj.method()`, then `this` is bound to the object holding the method
(in this case `obj`). `this` allows you to make changes to the local
object:

    function otherObject(value)
    {
        return {
            x: value,
            get: function() {
                return this.x;
            },
            set: function(newValue) {
                this.x = newValue;
            }
        };
    }

Now try running these examples:

    other = otherObject(3);
    other.x;
    other.get();
    other.set(5);
    other.get();
    other.x; // compare example to "createObject"

So far, so good: we've used `this` to change the value bound to the
`x` field in the object from the object itself. That's pretty
convenient.

However, the conenience comes with a caveat. The way JavaScript
decides to associate `this` with a given object is simple to explain,
but sometimes leads to strange behavior. The way it works is that
although `obj.someFunction` is the syntax to access the `someFunction`
slot from obj *and* `someFunction(parameter)` is the syntax to call a
the function value bound to `someFunction` with parameter `parameter`,
the syntax `obj.someFunction(parameter)` is *not* equivalent to
storing `obj.someFunction` to some temporary variable and calling
that. In other words, the syntax `obj.someFunction(parameter)`
consisting of those three things next to one another is *special* to
JavaScript.

Here's what can go wrong:

	function yetAnotherObject()
	{
		return {
			x: 3,
			get: function() { return this.x; };
		};
	}

	obj = yetAnotherObject()
	console.log(obj.get()); // fine
	var t = obj.get;
	console.log(t()); // *NOT* fine

What happened in the example that goes wrong is that when `t()` is
called, JavaScript doesn't see the special notation
`obj.method(params)`, and so it keeps the binding of `this` to its
present value.

Anytime you use `this` and something goes wrong, the first you should
try to check is whether some call in your chain forgot to set the
binding by using the right syntax.

# DOM Manipulation

So that is the very basics of JavaScript, and enough to get you
through pretty much everything we'll see in class.

Like
we've seen in class, the HTML we write is represented as a tree inside
a web browser. What we are going to turn to now are the JavaScript APIs that web
browsers provide to let you *edit* the DOM dynamically, so that we can
build our visualizations with code instead of text editors.

Let's get some boilerplate out of the way. (Note that the following
assumes that your document contains an element with `id` "hi". If not,
you'll have to create one such element first)

    function radians(v) { return v * (Math.PI / 180); }
    
The method `getElementById` is used to return get an element from the
DOM (remember that an 'element' is simply a tree node):
	
    mainDiv = document.getElementById("hi");
	
To add nodes to an existing node, use `appendChild`. To create text
content, use `document.createTextNode`:
	
    mainDiv.appendChild(document.createTextNode("This is some text"));
	
With these, we can start to build software that creates more complex trees:
    
    function divWithText(text) {
        var result = document.createElement("div");
        var textNode = document.createTextNode(text);
        result.appendChild(textNode);
        return result;
    }
    
    for (i=0; i<10; ++i) {
        mainDiv.appendChild(divWithText(String(i*i)));
    }
    
    x = divWithText("X");
    mainDiv.appendChild(x);
	
Sometimes, the appearance of an element is controlled by its
*attributes* (the things inside the opening tag; in `<div id="foo"/>`,
the attribute `id` has value `foo`:
    
    function textAt(text, x, y) {
        var node = divWithText(text);
        node.setAttribute("style", "position:absolute; left: " + x + "px; top: " + y + "px;");
        return node;
    }

With this, we can place text at specific positions on the screen:

    mainDiv.appendChild(textAt("hi", 20, 30));
    for (i=0; i<360; i+=30) {
        mainDiv.appendChild(textAt(
            String(i), 
            100 + 100 * Math.cos(radians(i)), 
            100 + 100 * Math.sin(radians(i))));
    }

Remember that in JavaScript we can attach new fields to existing
objects. You can do this to DOM elements returned by the API, and that
turns out to be very powerful:

    function numberText(v) {
        var node = divWithText(String(Math.floor(v)));
        node.update = function(amount) {
            v = v + amount;
            node.textContent = String(Math.floor(v));
            var x = 130 + 100 * Math.cos(radians(v));
            var y = 130 + 100 * Math.sin(radians(v));
            node.setAttribute("style", "position:absolute; left: " + x + "px; top: " + y + "px;");
        };
        node.update(0);
        return node;
    }

Note how in the above snippet, we are adding a new method `update` to
the node returned by `divWithText`. When this method is called, we use
add passed value to the current amount (stored at `v`), compute new
positions from `v`, and update the text content of the node.

With this function on hand, we can start working towards an animated
demo. We begin by creating a list of nodes and storing them in an
array.

    var nodes = [];
    for (i=0; i<360; i+=30) {
        node = numberText(i);
        mainDiv.appendChild(node);
        nodes.push(node);
    }

Then every time we want to move the nodes around the circle, we simply
call the `update` method:

    for (i=0; i<nodes.length; ++i) {
        nodes[i].update(10);
    }

If we put this in a function, then all we need to do is call the
function over and over again.

    function tick() {
        var i;
        for (i=0; i<nodes.length; ++i) {
            nodes[i].update(1);
        }
    }

We're almost there. The main issue, now, is that we have to be careful
not to send the web browser into an endless loop. For example, the
following does *not* work:

	// This will crash your browser (well, it'll send it looping
    // forever until Chrome decides to kill the JavaScript process)
	while (true) {
        tick();
    }
	
The reason for it is that although the element attributes are being
changed, the user of the web browser does not get to see it, because
the web browser does not ever get a chance to update the graphical
representation of the DOM. The way to solve this problem is by using a
special browser API called `requestAnimationFrame`. This API lets you
tell a web browser that you'd like the opportunity to change something
in the DOM. The next time the web browser is sitting idly,
after having drawn all of its needed graphics, it will call the
function passed as a parameter. Then, we just need to make sure that
after updating the graphics, we call `requestAnimationFrame` again. It
looks like this:

	// this works!
    function tickForever() {
        tick();
        window.requestAnimationFrame(tickForever);
    }
   
This is very much like a recursive version of the endless loop above
(`function f() { tick(); f(); }`).  The fundamental difference here is
that instead of making the recursive call directly, we ask the browser
to make the recursive call, *after* it has updated the graphics. This
way there's always a step in between every update where the web
browser updates the UI and graphics, and you get nice animations as a
result.
