# Assignment 1

- Posting date: Aug. 23rd 2016
- Due date: Aug 30th 2016, 11:59PM MST.
- Assignment name for `turnin`: `cs444_assignment_1`

# Description

Your first assignment is to fill out this questionnaire and submit it
via `turnin`. This is mostly so that I have a chance to learn somthing
about you, but it's also to ensure you know how `turnin` works, to
ensure *I* still know how `turnin` works, and to ensure that I can see
your submissions.

You will turn in a single plain-text file called `answers.txt`. 
This file should contain the answers to the questions below, formatted
roughly like this.

    1. I want to take this course because I want to learn about
	d3; I hear it will land me a great job.
	
    2. Java, Javascript, C#, PHP.
	
	3. Java.
	
	4. no answer.

You are not required to answer any of the questions if you don't want
to, but non-submission does not count: please write "no answer" if
that's the case. 

I am going to use the answers to calibrate the remainder of the
course, so this is an opportunity for you to influence where the
course goes. There are no right or wrong answers in this
questionnaire. All I ask is you answer honestly, without trying to
figure out what I might want to read. The more you write, the more
I'll know about your expectations and what you are interested in.

## Turnin instructions

*Do not turn in zip files*. Instead of turning in a zip file, please
turn in individual files one by one. `turnin` allows you to submit many
files for one assignment with no trouble. Simply submit it
file-by-file by calling turnin many times.

*Do not turn in subdirectories*. Instead of submitting an additional
directory, simply submit the files. So if you're working on
your assignment in a folder (say, "assignment3"), do *not* type `turnin
assignment_3 assignment3/index.html` or `turnin assignment_3
assignment3`. Instead, first change directory to the inner directory, and
submit file-by-file.

We're not going to deduct any points for these right now, but having
to handle these different cases separately makes Youhao's life much
harder.

# Questionnaire: tell me about you

1. Why are you taking this course?

2. What do you think you'll learn in this course?

3. What programming languages are you comfortable with?

4. Which programming language are you *most comfortable* with?

5. Have you ever created a data visualization? What was it?

6. During the course of your studies, what's
the largest dataset you've had to deal with? What tools did you use?

7. What's the best visualization you've ever seen? Why do you like it?

8. What's the worst visualization you've ever seen? Why do you not like it?

9. Tell me about something cool you learned recently. If you were
meeting with a friend, what would you chat about? Possible answers:
books, movies, TV shows, blogs, podcasts, etc. It does not have to be
about data visualization.

# How to use `turnin`

If you haven't used `turnin`, our department's assignment submission
system, you should go over
[Prof. McCann's submission instructions](http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/mccann/submission.pdf).
