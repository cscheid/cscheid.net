# Principles of Machine Learning

This is the index page for additional notes on "Principles of Machine
Learning". 

## Consistency warning

The content here will likely change as I adapt the material from
semester to semester (so the notes linked to from, say, Spring 2020
might not correspond exactly to the material taught on that specific
offering of the course).
