# Assignment 7

- Posting date: Apr. 14th, 2015
- Due date: Apr. 21st, 2015
- Assignment name for `turnin`: `cs444_assignment_7`

# Description

In this assignment, you will write a progress report on your final
project. If you are doing the final project as a team, each member of
the team must submit a copy of the report under their own username.

## Implementation Projects

You will submit a single PDF file of no more than two pages,
containing a description of:

- The dataset you will use

- What have you achieved so far

- What you are currently working on, and a brief description of your
  plans for the final version of the visualization tool.
  
Remember that the primary goal of the implementation project is to
have you work on all aspects of creating an interactive visualization,
from data cleaning and restructuring to designing appropriate
interactions for the data. Describe briefly how you intend to present
an overview of the dataset, and how you intend to provide zooming,
filtering, and details on demand.

## Research Projects

For the CS544 students that are doing a research-based final project,
this progress report will be a writeup of the problem area, your
proposed solution, and relevant research you have found in your
literature search (if you haven't found relevant related work, explain
your search process and you think you didn't find anything
relevant). Think of this as an extended abstract for the submission of
your future paper.  Submit a single PDF file of no more than two
pages.

## Assessment

If you submit a PDF document that I can read, you will get half the
credit for this assignment (50 points). The remaining credit for the
assignment will be given out based on whether the information I
requested in the above was provided in your writeup.
