# Final Project

In the final project for CS444/CS544, students picked a dataset of
their choosing (as long as it was sufficiently complex, as defined by
the instructing staff), and created an interactive visualization from
scratch. This included:

- data acquisition
- data cleaning
- conversion into a format readable by d3
- design of appropriate visual encodings to navigate the dataset
- multiple linked views (that is, filtering should be done without
  extraneous GUI elements like buttons and checkboxes whenever
  possible)

Here is a listing of the projects created by the students, including
screenshots and, when possible, links to the actual webpages.

# Project list: TBD
