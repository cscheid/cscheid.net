# Final Project

In the final project for CS444/CS544, students picked a dataset of
their choosing (as long as it was sufficiently complex, as defined by
the instructing staff), and created an interactive visualization from
scratch. This included:

- data acquisition
- data cleaning
- conversion into a format readable by d3
- design of appropriate visual encodings to navigate the dataset
- multiple linked views (that is, filtering should be done without
  extraneous GUI elements like buttons and checkboxes whenever
  possible)

Here is a listing of the projects created by the students, including
screenshots and, when possible, links to the actual webpages.

CS544 students, in addition, had the option of working on a
preliminary resesarch project of their choosing, as long as it

1) had something to do with data visualization

2) had a clear potential for publication in either an appropriate
venue for their particular field of research, or in a
visualization-specific venue.

The links for the research projects will be updated as the research
projects become paper submissions.
