# CS444/544: Data Visualization

## Learning goals

A successful 444 student will be able to

- Understand and characterize the main visual affordances in a 
  graphic
  
- Perform basic exploratory data analysis in datasets, and produce
  effective visual displays of data
  
- Critique and improve existing visualization design based on 
  principles and perceptual science

- Employ tools of the modern data visualization stack  

At the 544 level, a successful student will be able to, in addition to
the above,

- Implement a significant subset of the techniques discussed in class

- Identify and explore existing gaps in visualization research


## Main Topics

- Basics
  - 1D space
    * function plots, timeseries
    * data transformation; plotting in log space, coordinate systems

- human vision system
  - color
    - phenomenology
    - device-specific color spaces
    - CIELab and friends
      * why not HSV
    * consequences for design
  - Cleveland / McGill

- 2D space
  * scatterplots
  * cartographic projections
    - design considerations in each choice of projection
  - configuration space, phase plots
    - slide rules -> nomographs
  * dimensionality reduction
  * contour maps
  - vector maps

- relational data
  * graphs
  - general databases

- Systems
  * d3
  
- Interaction/animation
  * transitions
  * linked views
