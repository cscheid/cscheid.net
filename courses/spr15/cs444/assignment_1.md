- Assignment name for `turnin`: `cs444_assignment_1`

Your first assignment is to fill out this questionnaire and submit it
via turnin. This will ensure you know how `turnin` works, will
ensure *I* know how `turnin` works, and will ensure that I can see
your submissions.

# Assignment 1

You will turn in a single plain-text file called `answers.txt`. 
This file should contain the answers to the questions below, formatted
roughly like this.

    1. I want to take this course because I want to learn about
	d3; I hear it will land me a great job.
	
    2. Java, Javascript, C#, PHP.
	
	3. Java.
	
	4. no answer.

You are not required to answer any of the questions if you don't want
to, but non-submission does not count: please write "no answer" if
that's the case. 

I am going to use the answers to calibrate the remainder of the
course, so this is an opportunity for you to influence where the
course goes. There are no right or wrong answers in this
questionnaire. The All I ask is you answer honestly, without trying to
figure out what I might want to read. The more you write, the more
I'll know about your expectations and what you think is exciting.
