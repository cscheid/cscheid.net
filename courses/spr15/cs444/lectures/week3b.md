# Week 3b, basic SVG visualizations with JavaScript

Now that we've seen how SVG works, how JavaScript works, and how
web browsers provide a JavaScript API for manipulating the DOM, we
will create a very basic library for visualizations in
JavaScript. Although the library is very limited, its basic idea is
similar in spirit to d3, and when you understand how this library
works, you will be much more ready to understand why d3 works the way
it does.

We will start with a very straightforward program that draws a
visualization in a very hard-coded way, and we'll systematically make
small changes to this program to make it more generic.

## From zero to visualizations in eight steps

The best way to see how these examples work is to open them side by
side and compare the JavaScript source code.

6. [getter generators, higher-order functions](week3/iteration_6.html)
7. [generic plotAll for any SVG element, just like generic make in iteration 2](week3/iteration_7.html)
8. [Three different visualizations, each with 10 lines of code](week3/iteration_8.html)
