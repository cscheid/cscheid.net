# Data Visualization Principles

Now that you know all the basics of d3, we will turn to *principles*
of data visualization. We will start with color vision, which is
one of the many subtle aspects of vision in general. As we will see,
our vision system is as powerful as it is subtle. And because most of
us use it in every day of our lives, we take the subtlety for
granted. We now will start our investigation of how this part of our
perception works.

As principled designers of visualizations that will make use of color,
it behooves us to understand how we perceive color, how to manipulate
it, and what pitfalls to avoid.
