# Week 3, Javascript

This week, we'll learn the basics of Javascript, and we'll start
making simple animated things with it. By the end of the week you'll
have most of the tools you need to write visualizations in
Javascript. We'll use d3 because it is very powerful, but all that d3
does is use these APIs for you.
