# Assignment 4

- Posting date: Feb. 5th, 2015
- Due date: Feb 12th, 2015, 1:59PM MST (it is due *by thursday's
  lecture*)
- Assignment name for `turnin`: `cs444_assignment_4`


# Description

In this assignment, you will recreate some of the previous
visualizations we've seen in class. Specifically, you will recreate
the examples in the [last iteration](week3/iteration_8.html) of the
code we developed in Lecture 3, and you will also recreate the first
visualization of Assignment 3.

You will turn in an HTML file named `index.html`. Each visualization
should be an SVG element of the same dimensions used previously. The
`id` attributes of the elements shouls also match the ones we used
previously. In other words: they should be, respectively, `chart1`,
`chart2`, `chart3`, and `scatterplot_1`.

The final change is that, in previous assignments, the datasets were
provided as hardcoded variables. In this assignment, you will load the
JSON and CSV files explicitly.

For this assignment, you are allowed to use any library you'd
like. You are required to use [d3](http://d3js.org), but maybe you'll prefer to use
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/),
[underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/), or whatever else you like. Remember
to give proper attribution in your writeup and source code.

## Datasets

- Dataset 1, in JSON Format:
  [UK Driver Fatalities](assignment_4/ukDriverFatalities.json)
- Dataset 2, in CSV Format:
  [Calvin College senior scores](assignment_4/calvinCollegeSeniorScores.csv)
