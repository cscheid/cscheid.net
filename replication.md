## Repeatability, reproducibility, replication, oh my!

Is it replication or repeatability? Is it reproducible?

I'm happy that there's now widespread concern about experimental
issues in computer science. But there also seems to have been a
proliferation of terms in the CS literature.  I'm not going to try to
untangle that knot here. Instead, I'm just going to try and provide
links to source code and data from my papers.

In the interest of full disclosure, the table below also includes
papers that are *not* reproducible by any reasonable current
standards. The excuses include, but are not limited to, bit rot, lost
sources, and proprietary data.
