# Writing

I realized I don't like the way that a blog ends up being write-once,
never-change again (yes, I realize -- now -- it says "log" right in
the name). The organization ends up not making any sense, and it feels
like if I change my mind, I can't really edit what's already there. As
a result, blog posts end up being fleeting and specific to a
particular point in time (yes, exactly like a blog would). But I'm no
longer interested in this kind of stuff. I'm interested in being
wrong, and *then fixing it* so the stuff I do write sticks around a
little longer.

So I'm going to try a more general "writing" section. Here goes
nothing.

# Reading

I think I read too much [scifi](scifi_notes.html).

## Data Science

I've started writing down some notes on [data science](data_science/).
