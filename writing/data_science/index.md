# Notes on data science

This is a collection of small notes on data science. They are here
because I've found myself explaining some things to students over and
over again. These notes are more informal than what you may be
comfortable with, and should by no means replace actual textbooks on
probability, statistics, data mining, and machine learning.

I have found that students often lack the intuition that ties these
fields together. These notes try to explain some of the basic concepts
in a way that I hope will be useful to build intuitin.
