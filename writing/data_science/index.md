# Notes on data science

This is a collection of small notes on data science, slowly sprawling
into "notes on math" as I see need. They are here because I've found
myself explaining some things to students (and to myself!) over and
over again. These notes are more informal than what you may be
comfortable with, and should by no means replace actual textbooks on
probability, statistics, data mining, and machine learning.

I have found that students often lack the intuition that ties these
fields together. These notes try to explain some of the concepts
in a way that I hope will be useful.

## Basics

* [Trigonometry](trigonometry/index.html)
* [Linear Regression](linear-regression.html)

## Supervised Learning

Methods which use data to make predictions about new, unseen data.

* [Logistic Regression](logistic_regression/index.html)
* [Support Vector Machines](svm/index.html)
* [Error-correcting output codes](error_correcting_output_codes/index.html)

## Unsupervised Learning

Methods which, given a dataset that has a complex representation,
create simpler versions of the dataset.

* [Principal Components Analysis](pca.html)
* [Multidimensional Scaling](mds.html)
* [$k$-means](kmeans/index.html)

## Linear Algebra

* [Singular Value Decomposition](svd.html)
* [Adjoints and Inverses](adjoints-and-inverses.html)

## Other

* [Regularization](regularization/index.html)
* [A simple illustration of duality](duality.html)
* [Convolutions](convolution/index.html)
* [Eigenwhat?](/courses/fal16/cs444/lectures/lecture15/eigenvectors.html)
* [Automatic Differentiation](automatic_differentiation/index.html)
* [Randomized Response](randomized-response/index.html)

## Data visualization

* [B-Splines](b_splines/index.html). Intro to B-Splines.
* [Linear Function Spaces](linear_function_spaces/index.html). Brief
  intro to using linear function spaces and reconstruction kernels to
  represent continuous functions in a computer.
* [ODE integration](odes/index.html). Intro to numerical integration
  of ordinary differential equations.
