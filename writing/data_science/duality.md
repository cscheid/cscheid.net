## Duality

<div id="div-duality"></div>

The duality principle states that the <span class="blue">**smallest**</span> distance from a point
to a convex shape is also the <span class="red">**largest**</span> distance from a point to a
hyperplane tangent to the convex shape.

(Go ahead, drag the black point around.)
